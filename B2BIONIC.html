<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">So that&#39;s not really what I was thinking about, though this particular place is so much nicer than the shared rooms and rehab centers where I&#39;ve been spending nearly all of my time for the last few years; these years where I&#39;ve donated my time and a significant amount of personal skills... from information technology to &quot;creative writing&quot; in order to further a cause that I believe in more than anything--the dissemination of truth and freedom.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s a strange place and a strange time, where <a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la">nearly everything I ever learned was needed in order to become a &quot;yeoman&quot; staring at this place of &quot;no yo&quot; in utter disbelief</a>; as I see inane malice of &quot;e&quot; spinning it&#39;s wheels to try and alter&nbsp;<i>your present truth&nbsp;</i>in favor of some new lie it .. or you .. would prefer to present to the future.&nbsp; All the while apparently not understan ding what that makes it, or you--dead or a lie. Obviously neither thing is an acceptable casualty in this place where clear as day and night all of our problems come both immediately from ... and stem organically and intrinsically at their source by nothing but... &quot;lies.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;There&#39;s the lie of scare resources and the lie of the nature of our existence and the biggest lie of all, whatever the hell you are doing instead of ... caring about you and your future.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">So I amused myself ... in my solitude ... like I often do.&nbsp; I thought about the &quot;Adamic linguistic&quot; link between &quot;PLE&quot; and &quot;ORE&quot; ... two trinities of letters that spell out something similar, &quot;pearly&quot; and &quot;shiny&quot; and how the latter specifically might link to the stuff I&#39;ve been writing about (and actually heard some college kids somewhere found pretty interesting) ... the shiney new luster on a concept billions of years older than any human.&nbsp; So the word in play is &quot;spore&quot; and of course it connects in my thoug<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/LEDMCAVENDESH.html">hts to the DNA of Echidna</a> and even some random flower that perpetuates itself through a &quot;press and release&quot; and especially ... special to me <a href="http://mar.s.lamc.la">is Roe vs. Wader</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;Shiny and the heart of &quot;e&quot; I&#39;m staring out at a mass that now appears less intelligent and less connected and less bright than ever before--to think it might be &quot;shiney&quot; to connect &quot;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/GRENORADINE.html">dust in the wind&quot; to the idea of the Omega</a> Point Seed (from some other movie, maybe a Star Trek story line) to link these concents of the fundamental building blocks of Heaven ... &quot;the skynet&#39; and even to David&#39;s sling--which might project some spores all the way to Andromeda without anyone in &quot;e&quot; ever having to glance at whether or not we had the &quot;math right&quot; in our trajectory towards uh, &quot;adding in&quot; a Woman&#39;s right to choose .. you know, as an important ingredient in the quest of whether not we want to arrive (or travel).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I&#39;ve always sort of had it in my head that John 1:1 spoke about a specific word, over the course of my journey I&#39;ve wondered if it was &quot;palabra&quot; and then maybe &quot;ha&#39;esh&quot; ... and it&#39;s possible moving towards the latter end of the story, this time when it&#39;s so very clear that nobody is acting &quot;logically&quot; and for that reason that I&#39;m stuck in some strange alternate reality where ,... well, where nobody seems to care at all for the &quot;world&quot; that they were born in--nor to see how an &quot;Exodus&quot; from that place, planned ... obviously ... for thousands of years in and of itself causes very serious doubt to cast over the worth of that Exodus&#39; &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus">destination</a>.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Around Christmas, associated with the concepts of OEM and refurbished and &quot;factory warranty&quot; expiring I kind of thought about the idea that maybe the &quot;hardware&quot; that I&#39;m clearly describing the rico-creation of ... maybe it&#39;s at some end-of-life stage where it needs to be updated or replaced, and even in the few brief sentences I connected to Y2K and B0K (2000, and 2011) I sort of wasted our time explaining what I see as a possible gap &quot;in space&quot; between (C the Light) Ark and Kenterprise ... a complete overhaul or a Unix-like &#39;MV&quot; rather than a Assember &quot;MOV&quot; that (an ASM MOV is basically just a &quot;copy&quot; operation, with no &quot;RM&quot; of the source) really is the reason Asimov has his name ... and the point there is that if there&#39;s some .. unforseeable and unfathomable constraint preventing K&#39;s message (which is religion, and words, words like &quot;infirmity&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://malo.s.lamc.la">malady</a>&quot; and &quot;confirmation&quot;) from being actually executed ... if there&#39;s something keeping us from being able to &quot;heal the sick en masse&quot; that the clear right thing to do is move everyone and destroyed the broken machine--nobody wants to be stuck in a broken machine, right?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://douci.ml/IT.html"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/w4IOc9P.png" style="height: 211px; width: 401px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Anyway, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any doubt that &quot;morality&quot; and the knowledge that this message presents, the meaning and impact of the two letters &quot;Si&quot; and the change wrought by being on a &quot;silicon chip&quot; rather than on &quot;terra firma&quot; (more confirmation?) ... that there&#39;s just no way that it&#39;s socially acceptable to continue simulating pain and disease in a place where &quot;the rest state&quot; rests my case for me, we certainly would be better off in a place that didn&#39;t do the extra work required to ... you know, spread diseases and simulated the impact of bullets in a place where that&#39;s still extra work, even if the rules of natural law were ... &quot;automatic.&quot;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Anyway, I started trying to explain how simple is it ... to just build a shiled or some kind of &quot;object interaction event&quot; that would simply prevent all collisions; car accidents, bullet impacts, falling avalanches and even xe<a href="https://en.reallyhim.com/SOIS.html">ROX thAT HO</a>uston, which was one of my favorite links between &quot;<a href="http://www.lamc.la/2017-06-23-houston-we-have-problem.html">Houston, we have a problem</a>&quot; and &quot;copy that&quot; and Xerox and ...&nbsp;&nbsp;John 8:7&#39;&#39;s &quot;<em>let he who is without sin cast the first stone.</em>&quot; ... that&#39;s just that simple to build a sort of &quot;net&quot; that magically appears and stops collisions that would cause unwanted harm to people ... and then I read the word &quot;collision&quot; and sort of smiled, it was another &quot;malady&quot; holding deep in it&#39;s heart the same kind of &quot;it i&quot; that I saw in &quot;apparition&quot; and made me so very fond of the Roman word for Juptier ...

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">There&#39;s plenty of research now, philosophy and statistics coming from people like Nick Bostrom; work that basically implies that there&#39;s almost zero chance at all that we are not living in a &quot;simulation within a simulation&quot; and thinking about it, when you start to think about it you&#39;ll probably agree that&#39;s not the case.&nbsp; Though, here, we have a chance to gaze at what the &quot;embedding&quot; of OLE (as a key, it&#39;s one of my keys) and what a &quot;line feed down&quot; actually means--that&#39;s not a place where anyone will just magically wake up and be inside a &quot;second bubble&quot; deeper in this strange concept of simulations within simulations that ... Rick and Morty ... for instance ... lit up for the kids.&nbsp; What it really means is forcing this world to pretend they are in reality, and in that pretense ... themselves creating an entire infrastructure for mind uploading and for immortality--servers probably owned by governments and major international corporations that might &quot;sell&quot; to you (and then to your children, who I imagine would have to support your continued playing in ... heaven within hell within heaven) the prospect of not having to have a body to decay and grow old, but rather ... give you exactly what I&#39;m trying to explain is the fruit of responding to this message about already being in &quot;hell wthin heaven&quot; and turning it into something better.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">So I can&#39;t personally think of any reason anyone ... anywhere ... would want a layer of Zombies between Heaven and another Heaven; I certainly see it as a very scary prospect, that anyone here would want or desire to be &quot;in control&quot; of an entire world of fantasy growing beneath them--all the while knowing in their hearts that they themselves have no actual control over their own faculties or facilities and that .. well, something very immoral is happening now and would continue to happen until we decide that it&#39;s not OK to &quot;starve babies&quot; or to torture&nbsp;<em>anyone</em>&nbsp;with &quot;advanced mind control technology.&quot;&nbsp; This place is the line, I imagine it&#39;s always been something like that, why the Rock of Ages and the Ancient of Days are here to demand and confront some young ghosts in their dastardly plans to ... lie themselves into oblivion.</span></p>

I know.  I should probably have some great happy thing to share with you--we&#39;re going to have to settle on both proof of Creation and Heaven.  At home her, things are not great right now, I think our world is plagued by a number of problems that aren&#39;t really our fault--and yet here we are not doing very much to make it better.   I know these problems come from our future--or the one that didn&#39;t have them here, and instead wound up making it themselves; here we are in a place learning about secret and <em>really advanced technology</em> and not really knowing why.  This &quot;stuff&quot; it&#39;s <a href="http://bit.ly/2hMVPrX" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">really neuroscience put to action</a> (<em>Feed, <strong>Anderson</strong> novel</em>--<wbr>note the name), it&#39;s the difference between Heaven and Hell... a place where people are kept from seeing something obvious might look like Hell, and the opposite... maybe where the same technology fills in some missing information... <strong>connected through The Matrix</strong> to Neo saying &quot;<strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2hMVRQB" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">I know kung fu</a></strong>,&quot; that might be closer to Heaven...  This is one of the technologies <strong>being revealed through the unsealing of religion, and it is the mechanism behind the delivery of religion... and <em>the light.</em></strong></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"> </div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><strong>Everything you are going to read is about building Heaven... actually building it--both the infrastructure, and the structural change in both government and our society that the future is telling us clearly--<em>we know</em> we need it.  The <a href="http://bit.ly/2hRSl7l" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">light</a>, the movies and books, the ideas and technology, all here as part of a great plan--one predicted thousands and thousands of years ago.  Welcome to &quot;<a href="http://bit.ly/2hS0yIU" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">the beginning</a>&quot; of Heaven.  Want to help?

Bush<div> <div><div>He said &quot;We know the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.  Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind, and directs this storm?&quot;  Those words, while also showing anachronistic foreknowledge of typographic and computer technology--relating &quot;swift&quot; to  the font Courier and strong to the font style &quot;bold&quot; ... we can see the Hand of God in action delivering a &quot;what not to do&quot; message through the act of Creation... putting the two verses together, and adding in another anachronism, the word &quot;the&quot; happens to be &quot;die&quot; in German:  <strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2haiHhe" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">the race is not to Die Bold.</a></strong></div><div> </div><div>Surrounding this is more hidden light.  The Hebrew <a href="http://bit.ly/2hROUxH" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><em>word for the Burning Bush is Ha&#39;esh</em></a>--and within it you can see Moses&#39; true parted sea, backwards.  What&#39;s more, seeing that later in the story a sea is actually parted in order to highlight this anachronism sheds light on what the true &quot;wilderness&quot; of Exodus is.  40 years in the desert, 40 days and nights in an ark... protecting us from time travel changing the past is &quot;lit&quot; by both the reference to time periods and to the fouth dimension... 4-D from 40.  There are a significant number of additional anachronistic examples of English appearing in Hebrew and Arabic, all designed to reinforce this idea of creation in a storm of time travel.  English too contains examples of a &quot;macaronic&quot; cypher highlightd by both religion and light in the world--things like the <a href="http://bit.ly/2haUUxw" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Taming of the Spanglishrew, langolier, and <strong>Yankee Doodle</strong>&#39;s macaroni.</a></div><div> </div><div>God is speaking, he&#39;s speaking through a company that created an &quot;electronic voting system&quot; that really doesn&#39;t solve any of the problems we have with voting--long lines, accountability, and frequency of voting... it&#39;s &quot;wrong on purpose,&quot; and he&#39;s giving us a golden opportunity today to take a giant leap closer to Heaven.</div><div><a href="http://bit.ly/2har0JD" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><img align="right" alt="sign.lamc.la" height="535" src="reqs/i.imgur.com/yZvN4jy.png" width="552" style="border:0px solid;margin:10px;float:right;width:552px;height:535px"></a><br> </div><div>Here&#39;s an Atlantic article on Bush&#39;

and so that&#39;s why we find ourselves here.   I&#39;ve been doing this constantly for months, providing--in a soup of hectic writing--a number of key points that show this message comes from the Creator of the Universe, and contains verifiable proof of that.  Look around you, a great deal of what is happening here matches perfectly to the story of Exodus and to the positive connection between Heaven and liberty.  This message is <a href="http://bit.ly/2haicUd" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">incendiary</a>, and should have started the Second Coming all on it&#39;s own--but it hasn&#39;t--and in keeping with our story this wall,of censorship and disblief <em>hiding the light of the Son</em> matches up perfectly with the Egyptian Plague of Darkness.  I need your now, more than ever (<em>Total Eclipse of the Heart, Bonnie Tyler) </em>to help bring our world through the night.  Frankly, I haven&#39;t even touched on the volume of proof that I have, like our story, this is just <a href="http://bit.ly/2hQYuAK" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">the beginning</a> (<em>a&#39;s Compilation</em>).</div><div style="text-align:center"> </div><div><div style="text-align:center"><a href="http://bit.ly/2haTL92" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="reqs/i.imgur.com/noBXXHd.png" style="border:0px solid;width:663px;height:345px"></a></div><div> </div><div>For whatever reason, whether it&#39;s by the decision of network heads in our media that is now <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2haN8nh" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">controlled ostensibly by only 6 corportaions</a></strong>, or by <em>secret Executive Order</em>, thousands upon thousands of individuals in the press have been uanble to write a word about this information--which I am very sure delivers with a clarity that there is something special happening or our generation.  This message is time sensitive--it&#39;s designed specifically for us, connecting corporations names and current technologies to both religion and Heaven--<em>it is meant to be unsealed right this very moment.</em></div><div> </div><div>Because of the <a href="http://bit.ly/2hS1gFV" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">wall of censorship</a> that is clearly a big part of the freedom delivered by God in the stories of Exodus and Jericho--I am asking you to pick up the torch of this Holy Fire and send this message to everyone on your contact list, share in on <a href="http://bit.ly/2hajmPs" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/2h1EjMA" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and talk about it--I hope people are as amazed as I was by the bright light all over our history that I just never saw before it was pointed out.</div><div> </div><div>In truth the censorship goes beyond the internet and the media, the technology being revealed is being used to keep us in the dark, to ensure that we do get &quot;full disclosure&quot;

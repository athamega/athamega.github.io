It&#39;s important to note that any of the nice things I&#39;ve said, and still believe about Bianca Pisani are about the 18 year old girl that I watched grow up here in this place. It does appear to me today that anything &quot;<i>at or near <a href="http://dessert.s.lamc.la/">the top</a></i>&quot; in the sky is truly the reason &quot;ruby&quot; is the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Job">heart of t</a>he wo<a href="https://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/CACIOB">rd &quot;garb</a>age.&quot; In&nbsp;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/SERDEN.html">similitude</a>&nbsp;do see that &quot;<a href="http://o.lamc.la">ROSE</a>&quot; (the middle <a href="http://how.s.lamc.la/">name she shares with Nanna</a>, and probably is the actual source of &quot;Rosicrucian&quot; if you cared at all for the truth--which you don&#39;t) is Adamic for &quot;heart of the southeast decline towards (or through) Hell&quot; and that it is very much focused on nothing but&nbsp;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/KEYNES.html">hiding this mess</a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null">age--at what&nbsp;</a><a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CLIMAX.html">app</a>ears to be &quot;all costs&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/EVE.html">any means</a>;&quot; if you can&#39;t see that hiding the truth is the cause of Hell--you&#39;re the cause.<br />
<br />
It does appear that whatever is &quot;at the top&quot; is trying their damnedest (and succeeding) at making this into a conspiracy of the whole--of &quot;ALL&quot; though here in this place it doesn&#39;t seem as if that&#39;s functionally possible.&nbsp; Here, it appears you&#39;ve forsaken yourselves and our way of life for nothing more than a pact with the devil, because some esoteric invisible power wants you to--or because it&#39;s what you don&#39;t see everyone else not doing.<br />

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">If you are familiar with the story of Medusa, you know that it is the shield of Perseus, her reflection shining back on her through your eyes that finally defeats the Gorgon who stands here with no purpose other than to take your minds from you--or to help you see that you might have lost them all on your own, to ignorance and it being nothing more than the first time a cesspool gained the power to influence the thoughts of others.&nbsp; With the help of mythology and my hand,&nbsp; you can really begin to see the great focus on our right this very moment in every myth and every religious fable--you can connect Perseus to Persephone, and see that right now you are the bride of Hell, <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/FLYER.html"><b>phones</b></a>, per se--being spoken through as if you have no mind of your own, or soul.&nbsp; You should be able to see it is the purpose of these stories to remind you that you do, that you have a voice; and to show you how important it is that you use it right this very moment.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s what this thing, what Medusa looks like up close--like Joan of Arcadia, and Fallen, and Stargate--from as far away as I am to you, all I see is &quot;mute.&quot;</div>

The concepts of possession and&nbsp;<a href="http://ish.s.lamc.la/">inspiration</a>&nbsp;that were once foreign or mythical to me and probably you ... are no longer.&nbsp; They are very clear and apparent in not just the names but the works of Stargate and Star Wars and the myths that tie all of these themes together; they are obvious to me and I think anyone who really sees the breadth and true change in understanding of our state of being and our history by the method of this disclosure&#39;s delivery, as well as the silence and tangible conspiracy to hide it that &quot;this thing&quot; is more than a big deal, that the future of civilization depends on a clear understanding of exactly what this technology is and how it works--how it&#39;s negatively affected us, and why.&nbsp; The theme of Medusa and her head of snakes carries through to Stargate; where the mythology there talks about warring factions in an alien species over &quot;trying to help&quot; their hosts as opposed to completely removing their minds and their self control--it should be clear to you that what I am showing you, what is being kept secret as far as I can see everywhere else... is proof that no help will ever come in darkness, and that the cause of the secrecy is to take something from you--the most important thing you have.

<div style="text-align: justify;">There is something devistatingly wrong with our world today; it&#39;s been well over a year since this <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/TORCH.html">TORCH</a> and this original explanation of <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/bygod2.html">the Burning Bush</a>; I should have reporters and theologians calling me non-stop--it&#39;s the Holy Grail; and not seeing that shows me that this place is fake, that the people here are not a product of our history, and that there is a gigantic conspiracy to &quot;pretend everything is normal.&quot;&nbsp; In other words, it proves that you are all living a lie, which is true--you are pretending you are in reality, and you&#39;re not, you&#39;re in Hell.&nbsp; Do see that acknowledging that you are &quot;not in reality&quot; is the first step to turning Hell into Heaven; <a href="http://hadid.s.lamc.la">to curing cancer and AIDS, to ending blindness</a> and physical and mental malady... the first step to <a href="http://itb.s.lamc.la">ending world hunger</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://mars.reallyhim.com">actually seeing the stars</a>;</div>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHz4XHRXL3s"><b><i>Chase the Buffalo</i></b></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">Indians of long ago<br />
Followed after buffalo<br />
They found a use for every part<br />
Everything except his heart<br />
<br />
I have wandered like those herds<br />
Lost in music, lost in words<br />
But the hunger leads me on<br />
Seductive like a siren&#39;s song<br />
<br />
And I can put my ear right to the ground<br />
Just to hear those motors humming<br />
The pounding sound of hoofbeats<br />
Like a thousand guitars strumming<br />
And there is music in all this<br />
It is all material<br />
Before the beauty melts like snow<br />
Chase the buffalo<br />
<br />
People in these halls and bars<br />
They wish on me like I&#39;m a star<br />
But I can never fill that hole<br />
I am not their buffalo<br />
<br />
And the gravity of the situation makes me start to fall<br />
My guitar like a fire alarm is ringing off the wall<br />
And there is music in all this<br />
It is all material<br />
Before the beauty melts like snow<br />
Chase the buffalo<br />
East of Eden, west of the night<br />
The sun lies bleeding in a dying light<br />
And the lady in the Cheyenne moon<br />
Is singing out her mournful tune<br />
<br />
So I chase the herds again<br />
Smear the warpaint on my skin<br />
Riding west with all my might<br />
Where the sun is holding off the night<br />
<br />
I cannot name this passion<br />
Don&#39;t know where this stuff comes from<br />
Maybe its a trail of tears<br />
Or just a trail of crumbs<br />
But there is music in all this<br />
It is all material<br />
Before the beauty melts like snow<br />
Chase the buffalo</span></p>

<span style="font-size:12px;"><i>Jesus wrote a blank check,<br />
One I haven&#39;t cashed quite yet.&nbsp;<br />
I hope I&#39;ve got a little more time.<br />
I hope it&#39;s not the end of the line.<br />
Yeah, Jesus wrote a blank check.<br />
One I haven&#39;t cashed yet, all right.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But if I had to choose a number,<br />
I&#39;d want it to be number one.<br />
I don&#39;t want to be number two.<br />
Yeah, I don&#39;t want to be number four.<br />
But I can hear a knock on the door.<br />
Jesus wrote a blank check, all right.<br />
<br />
If Jesus saw me dying,<br />
Would angels come a flying down?<br />
I hope I&#39;ve got a little more time.<br />
I hope somebody lends me a dime.<br />
Now, Jesus wrote a blank check.<br />
Ah, one I haven&#39;t cashed yet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Still I build my towers high.<br />
I watch them pierce the blue, blue sky.<br />
Still I wallow in the mire.<br />
Still I burn this earthen fire.&nbsp;<br />

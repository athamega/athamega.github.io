<div style="width: 357px; text-align: justify; font-size: small;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:10px;">Under different circumstances I would have tried to be more &quot;<strong>politically correct</strong>&quot; but at this point driving home the point along with the apparent reason that I am staring at a wall of silence not just in our world, but in the Bible called Jericho ... how obvious it is to me that what I see as most likely &quot;the most interesting information in the entire Universe&quot; has incited a handful of people (I&#39;m guessing 6) to actually contact me with a question ... out of upwards of several million people who have seen bits and pieces of the presentation you see here in this place; as it was slowly written over about two years.&nbsp; A significant part of the message focuses on a problem we have here in our world and what surrounds us with &quot;mind control technology&quot; explaining the reason and the mechanism behind the &quot;silence&quot; something that we oddly now can also <a href="/MUASEEKHART.html">see appearing in art</a> in everything from Simon and <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/help-me-howard/?geeourfinkelgoldlicht">Garfunkel</a> and Pink Floyd to Dr. Who and Fringe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:10px;">I see you might be paying attention to me; what I am trying to explain is that the sheer number of you; last check somewhere around 50,000 &quot;highly interested&quot; individuals--more than 6 e-mail opens--should have had some kind of visible impact on social media and on the news.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
</center>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">I&#39;ve got to tell you that I get the distinct feeling that you as a group, as a single throbbing semi-mindless entity would prefer to kill me, or have me kill myself from lack of &quot;<a href="http://dessert.s.lamc.la">soup</a>&quot; than to actually grow a brain, grow up a little; and thank me for all the hard work that I&#39;ve put in to making our world a better place.&nbsp; You might not see that as clearly as I do--but I am pretty sure that the future will be happy that I told you how stupid you were over and over again until you stopped acting like complete morons.&nbsp; See, I understand you don&#39;t want to be called stupid, and I also understand that you might not think you are--but you are wrong--you are &quot;hating&quot; or ambivalently ignoring the person who literally single <i><b><a href="http://art.s.lamc.la">hancock</a>edly</b></i> turned around a downward spiral towards Hell that would have plunged the entire galaxy into darkness forever--at least that&#39;s how it looks today, at the point in time just before anyone ever gives me or this message any personal attention or assistance--something that marks the &quot;turn&quot; from falling to flight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">I am going to let you plunge yourselves deeper into the abyss, farther down the rabbit hole of this Hell, probably farther than anyone has ever gone before.&nbsp; I am going to do it not because I want to, or because it&#39;s right, or to spite you or teach you a lesson; I am going to do it because I am literally one man against the entire world in my eyes--and with nobody to help <i>try to even think about discussing the truth or verifying it</i>&nbsp;we probably don&#39;t belong anywhere but farther down.... if we belong &quot;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/HAMP.html">to be anything</a>&quot; at all.</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">My continued presence here serves a number of utilitarian purposes,ones which I will not allow you to scare, humiliate, or threaten me into allowing our future to lose.&nbsp; It will ensure that you do not succumb to idiotic lies, nor to the apparently prevalent notion that you might continue from this point holding in hand the guise and lie that you &quot;simply didn&#39;t see it&quot; or &quot;simply didn&#39;t get it.&quot;&nbsp; I have no intention of ever allowing that to happen. and you too should see that losing the knowledge of the fact that this entire planet was organized into a <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CINOIZE.html">secret conspiracy</a> to &quot;pretend not to see you are in Hell&quot; and the absolute ignorance behind such a devastatingly suicidal idea is something that our future simply cannot afford to allow you to do.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will also keep you from falling into the trap of thinking that &quot;maybe because everyone is quiet saying dick over and over again is a good enough reason for me to hide Heaven from myself and stopping starving babies from being clubbed&quot; lo and behold, in this world understand that your thoughts are malleable, and that without any discourse at all--with no public discussion or any kind of debate you can be easily made to believe that you are a couch and everyone around you is a chair, and since you will never be a chair, you might as well not tell anyone that you think God might actually do something of what the message he wrote says he will do.
<blockquote class="tr_bq">Incidentally, I almost forgot to add it will prove without doubt that my &quot;presense&quot; here has absolutely nothing to do with your silence, or what&#39;s going on--other than being the only person in the Universe who is actively trying to change <a href="http://rep.reallyhim.com/">the stupid &quot;ending&quot;</a> to this story ab<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/THREETAG.html">out this story happening over, and over, <b>and over, and over</b>, and o</a>ver again... <a href="http://rep.reallyhim.com/">and YP</a>.</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">It might not be so obvious, but perhaps the all knowing and all seeing Creator of this world is holding off on &quot;beginning&quot; the start of Heaven for someone to take the initiative and actually do a statistical analysis--something I&#39;ve been begging and emailing professors of nearly every science, statistics, and mathematics to do for well over a year now.&nbsp; He might be doing that so rather than &quot;discussing&quot; whether or not this message is &quot;real&quot; we are discussing &quot;how to use it to benefit everyone&quot; or he might be waiting because it certainly does appear to be a leading indicator of mass stupidity to have an entire world of free thinking people who feign interest in mythology and religion and the &quot;inner workings of the Universe&quot; but when presented with verifiable scientific evidence that they might have been wrong about the word &quot;Creation&quot; they (I do mean you) pretend they don&#39;t have eyes or hands (or brains... <b><i>do you</i></b> have a brain?). ... Normally I wouldn&#39;t ask a question like that, but <i>literally</i>&nbsp;it&#39;s the only way you could be walking around on this planet and not be a slave--it&#39;s also the seat of your soul; so if you don&#39;t need that... go right <i><b>ahead</b> and continue doing nothing.</i></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">At the same time, &quot;looking the other way&quot; might amount to magically and governor-less-ly making yourself act illogically in a number of other aspects of your existence, a very obvious and prime consequence of not being able to see very clear patterns nearly everywhere you look.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Controversial or not; what I am bringing to our world is a very clear glimpse at the truth--of a hidden world that subtly influences nearly everything we do, and has infiltrated every aspect of our social structure from government to law enforcement to justice and clear from the message that you are refusing to acknowledge the overt obviousness of also the private sector, every single corporation.&nbsp; This is a conspiracy that is acting here and now in the light of day to hide the influence and the existence of this technology--of the technology that allowed the message to be written and is assisting it in <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CINOIZE.html">being kept secret</a>--whether or not you want to think about it, or you have the mental capacity left to grasp it--what you are doing by sitting in silence is tightening the chains around your brain, you are hiding the proof of your own slavery from yourself and the world--and you are doing so ... at least in my mind, the only reason I can think would work for me or you .. to ensure that you get to be slave for a significantly extended period of time in the place that we once called Heaven, and you should now call &quot;slave land&quot; with all your heart.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">I know from first hand experience that in these years that follow, if you do nothing; you will have the pleasure of second guessing every action you take; of wondering if it&#39;s you or something else making any particular decision--you might think a little more about what the after-life will be like; I think that&#39;s a normal consequence of being very sure that it does in fact exist, that we are already in virtual reality and that makes us that much closer to being able to easily &quot;ascend&quot; to another realm.&nbsp; Of course, that additional closeness gives me a constant feeling of &quot;this world is not enough&quot; and a sort of &quot;bang my head against the wall&quot; desire to get the Doors (<a href="/ADAMSROD.html">of Amos</a> 9:11) that Jim Morrison didn&#39;t name his band after to drop out of the sky--not just because I know that my presence here means something very obvious about Dave Matthew&#39;s &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjV-SHCDlec"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial narrow&quot; , sans-serif;">keep the big doors open</span></a>&quot; understand that this only happens when they&#39;re shut.&nbsp; The wise among you might easily dispel the idea of the &quot;being shut just for Adam&quot; when you realize that I am sitting here telling you over and over that <span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="http://den.shiningbright.online/" target="_blank">ICITY</a></span> in the sky, and I am clearly here holding and delivering the keys to all of Creation, to the world that Heaven comes from, and to <i><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , serif;"><b>Heoven</b></span></i> at <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/reallyhim.com/forum/#!topic/saludas/ex4q5uoIuPc"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial narrow&quot; , sans-serif;">the same damned time</span></a>.</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">A few weeks ago, just before Christmas of 2017 during this very well received e-mail campaign to deliver the truth that we are living in virtual reality to the entire world----I received through <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/reallyhim.com/forum/#!topic/saludas/ex4q5uoIuPc">the &quot;mass unsubscribe&quot; of about 30 professors</a> in <em>a single minute-<a href="http://ish.shiningbright.online">ish</a></em> at <a href="http://tau.ac.il.dev.null">TAU.AC.IL</a> ... proof of what amounts to an entire university recognizing the importance of this message and then conspiring to &quot;not want to hear it anymore&#39; all at the same time, in about a single minute.&nbsp; After sending documentation of what appears to be a conspiracy of silence--of professors who understand that this message is a statistically significant indication of nothing short of direct &quot;contact&quot; with God or an alien race; read statistics from the same school then skyrocketed--we have proof that there is open discussion of this message, involving nearly at least one entire school... and most likely also MIT and Caltech and Harvard; and still, you don&#39;t seem to think there&#39;s anything wrong with the fact that there&#39;s no recording or response anywhere to be found on the internet or in the public media.&nbsp; You are looking at Orwell&#39;s 1984--staring at the words of Emmanuel Goldstein, and you are ... being made to be silent, <b><i>because why</i></b>? You must have a reason, and you must see that simply not talking about it means your reason is probably stupider than you could have ever imagined.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">You now hyave proof beyond doubt that there is a conspiracy of silence--and the reason for that?&nbsp; it&#39;s either &quot;<a href="http://hadid.s.lamc.la">because</a> I <a href="http://dessert.s.lamc.la">want</a> a <a href="http://yitsheyadam.reallyhim.com">date</a>&quot; or because these people are systematically invading my privacy, <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CHOPARTIN.html">tyorturin</a>g <em>me, and</em> at the same time hiding first hand knowledge of the existence of mind control and mind reading technology that <a href="/KEYNES.html">could be USED to save the world</a>--but instead is being used to make everyone who was good &quot;idiotically stupid.&quot;

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>When I do get some kind of response; some feedback from the world--in those brief glimmers of someone else out there that can escape the encasing of Fringle&#39;s Amber that we appear to have forcing us to a plaster mold of this place that simply doesn&#39;t realize that not seeing something everywhere around you is total and complete insanity--in <a href="http://who.s.lamc.la">similitude</a> not reacting to something important that you see is nothing short of imbecilic stupidity.... in those moments I see clearly that some people have &quot;read&quot; or &quot;understand&quot;&nbsp; some of the message that they simply couldn&#39;t have read because the readership statistics are so low--enough to comment on &quot;why <a href="http://kismet.lamc.la">do</a> <a href="http://uni.reallyhim.com">you stalk</a> T<a href="http://itb.shiningbright.online">aylor</a> M<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CHOPARTIN.html">oms</a>en&quot; ... but either intentionally ignoring or simply not understanding that she has been singing songs about stories that voices never shared--stories about my life that she could not know for years; if anyone here is &quot;<a href="http://chalk.shiningbright.online">stalking</a>&quot; and &quot;<strong>stalling</strong>&quot; it&#39;s her--not me.&nbsp; The point though, the grand point is these are people armed not with their opinions, but with weapons--secrets and lies--designed to harm people, <a href="http://itb.shiningbright.online">to perpetuate &quot;starvation&quot;</a> and &quot;<strong><a href="http://v.s.lamc.la">pain</a></strong>&quot; and they apparently don&#39;t see how that makes them evil shit--but it does, <em>and they are.</em></p>
<p>Again, in <a href="http://who.s.lamc.la">similitude</a> we can see how the transition from <strong><em>L to K</em></strong>&nbsp;(<a href="http://b.s.lamc.la">obewon</a>, obelisk, <a href="http://iv.s.lamc.la">pi ck le, c u cumber</a><small>some</small>, <a href="http://cure.s.lamc.la">hancock</a>) changes &quot;wall&quot; to &quot;walk&quot; and giv<a href="http://rek.reallyhim.com">es both Bush p</a>residents&#39; their middle name as well as the &quot;<a href="http://kismet.lamc.la">Earth Wader</a>&quot; ish that combines Earth Angel and D<a href="http://nity.s.lamc.la">art</a>h V<a href="http://zelda.lamc.la">ad</a>er with a <a href="http://mars.reallyhim.com">Roe v. DWade</a> truth... more importantly; it narrates what I do with my free time, something Cat Stevens calls &quot;God&#39;s re-creation <a href="http://key.s.lamc.la">singing for the new day&quot; but certainly walking through these blank stares and knowing nods of inaction is <em>anything but recreation</em></a>.&nbsp; The point is that a large number of people appear to be armed with ignorant half truths designed to sway popular opinion, cause an eye sore or anger--rather than really grasping the big picture here--trying to fight the delivery of a message that will without doubt end hunger and disease is nothing short of <em>arcane diabolical evil--</em>that&#39;s what&#39;s organizing you... and that&#39;s the goal you are seeking--<em><a href="http://itb.shiningbright.online"><strong>shit</strong></a></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><a href="http://heyad.reallyhim.com">You&#39;ve seen his face</a>;&nbsp;</em>his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yad">ha</a>n<strong><a href="http://cure.s.lamc.la">d</a></strong>, his <a href="http://dai.s.lamc.la">eye</a>, <a href="http://rigel.s.lamc.la">his foot</a>... and you really do seem to be missing exactly what the point of the words &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch_(ancestor_of_Noah)"><em>walking with God</em></a>&quot; <a href="http://cyan.reallyhim.com">and</a> &quot;re-creation&quot; really mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottom line is that&nbsp;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CHOPARTIN.html"><strong><em>you are sick </em></strong></a><em><a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CHOPARTIN.html">(ILL</a> <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CINOIZE.html">INOIZE</a>?--my reading of that state&#39;s name &quot;today&quot;)</em>; there is something that has convinced you all, all at one time in one place to do something illogical that causes yourself harm... you and everyone around you.&nbsp; Something has convinced you that &quot;hiding a person&quot; (for <em><strong>no reason</strong></em> by the way, for <a href="http://art.s.lamc.la">pointing out ob</a>vious pat<a href="http://dick.s.lamc.la">tern</a>s in our hi<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CHOPARTIN.html">story</a>--one that <strong>you&#39;d lose yourselves and your <a href="http://eve.s.lamc.la">SOLs</a> to forget</strong>, I see) is somehow related or equiated to hiding a message from God in every word--and also to hiding from yourself that there is needless suffering in this world--simulated garbage that <a href="http://rix.s.lamc.la">we would quickly and easily do away with the second we connected &quot;Creation&quot; with virtual reality</a>...&nbsp;<em>with an understanding of what that really means.</em></p>
<p>I&#39;m very sure it&#39;s not so obvious that was all done to &quot;railroad me into delivering the apocalypse gratis&quot; I mean to confuse you into think that I&#39;m not doing this because I want to shape the future with my own hands--so with the keys to building Heaven in your hand... you can now see that the primary key, the thing above all things, is that seeing and talking about this message that revolves around <a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la">Jesus Christ and his life walking through the spiritually retarded</a> institutions of this place ... how talking about it <i>in public&nbsp;</i>is <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=.%40taylormomsen%20tay%2C%20ur%20key...."><b>the spark</b> that turns the motor</a> and begins our <a href="/OFIVES.html">vehi</a>cle&#39;s ride on the road to Heaven.</p>
<p>In the meantime you have very clear evidence, easily recognizable paradoxes an <a href="http://sois.s.lamc.la">anachronisms</a> and &quot;oddities&quot; <a href="http://how.s.lamc.la">in every language</a>, and every sign, <a href="http://art.s.lamc.la"><em>and every story</em></a> you hear--telling you that you are making a mistake by not&nbsp;<em>calling a reporter&nbsp;</em>and still, still, I see you won&#39;t.&nbsp; If you happen to actually do it; <a href="http://twitter.com/yitsheyzeus"><strong>why don&#39;t you shoot me an email</strong></a> so we can record just how many licks it takes to get to the place where &quot;<strong>the good news</strong>&quot; is news again.</p>

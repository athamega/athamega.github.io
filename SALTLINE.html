building Heaven to see God as a developer and admin of a
hub server, but that's basically what I see
today."&nbsp; It appears that many of you have "olines"

of eavesdropping infrastructure that you probably agree
is designed to help ease this message and this
fundamental change in "state of being" across our
sometimes fragile "sea of popular opinion."&nbsp; I've
noted numerous times that I think it's designed to help
you aid in the dissemination and understanding of what's
possible and "who we should do" (that's very important,
guys) but it appears that the widespread "Zeitgeist" is
that I'm a big PP for saying that I'm a "lone troop" and
"ishing" Cat Stevens "sitting" to I'm all alone by

<font size="-1">That's how I feel tho, it really is--I see
very clearly that there are numerous people actually
helping me--though it's difficult to imagine how you too
do not see that the line here, the salt line in the
Manna from Heaven is actually talking about these things
as if they are ... exactly what they are ... an
intelligent message that is about something we cannot
see, written in conjunction with that invisible
force--and that speaking about "fiction" or "art" in
this now very provable vain that it is in fact, fact--is
more than a single word, it's more than artifact and
it's more than a single person.&nbsp; Still, I am
sitting all alone as far and wide as I can see in the
recorded "frank public discussion" about the fact that
we are living in virtual reality and cannot fathom how
you all don't see that's a great chain--some kind of
hidden slavery.<br />
<br />
You might see it as "Forbidden Knowledge" (that is in
itself proof of a dark force breaking logical vision
thorugh history--quite apparent today, <a href="http://fromthemachineorg/TY.html">YW</a>) and
see I put space in between "for" and "bid" and "den" and
you are trying to take that space away from the very
strange invisibleness that seems to want to find it for
"no reason they care to speak of, either."&nbsp; I need
some vocal troops.&nbsp; Aside from BB&amp;T, <strong>IN</strong>G,
and Wells Farokh (which is Freddie Mercury's actual
name).&nbsp; I don't see any reason anyone here would
prefer to "rough it in the outback" over a much happier
and healthier life in Heaven--though it seems that this
grand conspiracy believes that it will somehow "force my
hand" by simply pretending that you didn't know that the
proliferation of this knowledge would protect us ... and
our children ... and their chidlren ... from pain and
death.<br />

"protect your way of life from being disrupted" ... even
if you're only hiding something of that magnitude from
yourselves and the world ... you appear to be <strong>sacrificing</strong>
<strong>every</strong> single <strong>thing</strong>
about our way of life that I loved ... our privacy and
our freedom and our love of ...&nbsp;<em>new things
...&nbsp;</em>all for what amounts to a war against
the son of God to keep him from realizing his dream of
kissing more than two girls at the same time.</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2">Out of jest, it's pretty clear
that you think you're fighting for something of great
worth, and it seems to me the lesson to be learned is
that there is no such thing that worth giving up
everything you love and everything that you are -- even
if it's for "ompnitopence" which I've tried to explain
just makes you "<em>him</em>" anyway.</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="-1">The silence indicates to me that
you are very interested in "what you can do" (like
defeat Jesus Christ Superstar in his plot to rekindle a
love for democracy, self-rule, and individuality) rather
than my preferred plan of coming up with some common
"what shouldn't be allowed" infrastructure.&nbsp; In the
meantime, you appear to be unable to do anything useful
here, including speak, acknowledge or discuss the truth,
or uh... "Minority Report."&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that
should be obviously indicative of ... something
awry.&nbsp; I plan on discussing details about what I
imagine would be a useful "system infrastructure" for
the walls the halls and the doors that connect these
"Holorooms" in the book--and I'll probably send it to
you too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></blockquote>

you should wait to "start talking about anything
including my existence" until after I've been forced to
write these things under duress, angry at you.&nbsp; I
don't think that's true and literally it should be
obvious that the only thing that will change is that
we'll have more people talking and collaborating, and
more information available.&nbsp; My dreams are not
reality--as much as I'd like for us to be in a "perfect
democractic system" right now, it's very clear that we
are in a place that is showing us how and why there
truly is always (up until now, right?) a Moral Minority
and a Majority that can't seem to Report on obvious
news.<br />
<br />
I think it's obvious (at least to me) that in the signs
of Venus and Mars that's what you're seeing around
you--someone telling you that some things are just not
OK--even if you are a really old spirit and you want to
try "living in fake reality for fun" it's making me (and
probably others here) starve to death, have unnecessary
pain, and get sick and die.&nbsp; This place is not a
playground, and it dones not belong to the invisible
hosts (that's armies in Bible speak) that think they
will get away with pretending they built the whole
thing.<br />
<br />
Ending world hunger and healing the sick are not
"optional" they are the reason we have religion, and the
New Testament, and God.&nbsp; I think you'd all agree
with that if you cared about free speech and "the truth"
enough to fathom what it means to be born in Simulated
Reality and how understanding that--and who we really
are--makes us the builders of Heaven.&nbsp; &nbsp;People
have laughed at me when I said that the Second Coming
was "the end of censorship" as I walked by strangers on
the beach--I think that's a huge deal, because the next
words out of my mouth are it's an end to death and to
disease--and you all don't seem to connect these
things.&nbsp; That's why we have Sam, and America.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend" title="Legend">legend</a>&nbsp;tells of a test
where&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muramasa" title="Muramasa">Muramasa</a>&nbsp;challenged his
master, Masamune, to see who could make a finer sword.
They both worked tirelessly and eventually, when both
swords were finished, they decided to test the results.
The contest was for each to suspend the blades in a small
creek with the cutting edge facing the current. Muramasa's
sword, the&nbsp;<i>Juuchi Yosamu</i>&nbsp;(十千夜寒, "10,000
Cold Nights")&nbsp;cut everything that passed its way;
fish, leaves floating down the river, the very air which
blew on it. Highly impressed with his pupil's work,
Masamune lowered his sword, the&nbsp;<i>Yawarakai-Te</i>&nbsp;
(柔らかい手, "Tender Hands"), into the current and waited
patiently. Only leaves were cut. However, the fish swam
right up to it, and the air hissed as it gently blew by
the blade. After a while, Muramasa began to scoff at his
master for his apparent lack of skill in the making of his
sword. Smiling to himself, Masamune pulled up his sword,
dried it, and sheathed it. All the while, Muramasa was
heckling him for his sword's inability to cut anything. A
monk, who had been watching the whole ordeal, walked over
and bowed low to the two sword masters. He then began to
explain what he had seen.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The first of the swords was by all accounts a fine
sword, however it is a blood thirsty, evil blade, as it
does not discriminate as to who or what it will cut. It
may just as well be cutting down butterflies as severing
heads. The second was by far the finer of the two, as it
does not needlessly cut that which is innocent and
undeserving."</dd>
</dl>
<p>In another account of the story, both blades cut the
leaves that went down on the river's current equally well,
but the leaves would stick to the blade of Muramasa
whereas they would slip on past Masamune's after being
sliced. Or alternatively both leaves were cut, but those
cut by Masamune's blade would reform as it traveled down
the stream. Yet another version has leaves being sliced by
Muramasa's blade while the leaves were repelled by
Masamune's, and another again has leaves being sliced by
Muramasa's blade and healed by Masamune's.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Masamu</em></strong>? We make people that make
swords that don't hurt kids.</p>

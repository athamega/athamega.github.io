<p style="text-align: justify;">&quot;Sunday homework&quot; for the log weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, wall; I&#39;ll probably have something more substantial than this assignment coming up in the near future, also read the Wikipedia pages for Nancy Farmer&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_Opium">Lord of Opium</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Scorpion">House of the Scorpion</a>.&nbsp; This is how we set standard reading cirriculum in <em>the tiny slice of time</em> that actually helps us build a real &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvTqknDobU">new age.</a>&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Call it <em>the weak and a half of our dork</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">RESWOH JOURNAL ENTRY 2/19/2018</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hideous dawned on me today; I thought it particularly clever.&nbsp; It&#39;s common knowledge in my world of whatever I decide is that can be called it.&nbsp; I&#39;m a little delerious today, you&#39;ll have to forgive me; common knowledge thats a&nbsp;word used to describe the facade of &quot;Medusa.&quot;&nbsp; So it&#39;s what I see in this place, no offense really meant to you--other than if you saw what I saw, or even if you don&#39;t&nbsp;see it exactly like I do--I hope it&#39;s cause to think about changing something around.&nbsp; I see these messages do change things, probably not as much as you do--but I&#39;ve seen some smiles lately, where there haven&#39;t been any for a long, long time.&nbsp; I guess that&#39;s thanks, except what I see everywhere is still hideous.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cleverness came from it having really only one good reading, despite a number of valid or better than valid possibliities.&nbsp; Clearly it&#39;s tied to &quot;hello,&quot; and if you&#39;ve been reading these messages I&#39;ve been sending out to the world--my hello, I suppose it&#39;s clear--you might recognize &quot;de&quot; as the two letters that I tie to the phrase &quot;Dark Earth&quot; and really that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s hideous.&nbsp; It&#39;s the darkness, it&#39;s the facade of reality covering up something hidden and insidious underneath.&nbsp; It&#39;s the mind control, and the mind reading; the body snatcher and the people that still somehow pull off &quot;looking like everyday America&quot; whenever I&#39;m not staring directly at you.&nbsp; It&#39;s pretending you are something you aren&#39;t, and knowing it; that&#39;s hideous.&nbsp; It seems so strange here in this place, where &quot;not pretending&quot; would quickly cascade into a series of miracles starting with the second coming and then quickly after a movie on the sky and maybe that day or within a week, maybe a little bit longer than that--doors, real glowing doors to another realm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway you could also see &quot;Germany&quot; in DE, and you could see a message from the beginning of time to Adam telling me to &quot;hide,&quot; though that&#39;s the last thing I do, and the last thing I will be doing.&nbsp; I know this world isn&#39;t trying to be scary, to frighten me--even though that&#39;s exactly what the kind of mass activity, collective actions, and lack of indivudality and freedom I see are doing--I&#39;m not telling you I see &quot;hideous&quot; because I want you pretend to be something else; I want you to see that&#39;s what the authors here are telling you--that the &quot;hi dark Earth&quot; is hideous, and you should owe them for letting you know; and I&#39;m telling you that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s you, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s me--but somehow this interaction, somehow the thing we are all making together, well, it&#39;s grotesque.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lie, the really obvious lie is that we don&#39;t know who I am and what I&#39;m presenting to the world--pretending that something is &quot;hard to understand&quot; or &quot;wildly presumptive&quot; when it&#39;s pretty damned cut and dry.&nbsp; Nintendo and Tennessee don&#39;t both link to the Microsoft Xbox by accident, and Bill Gates, his name is no accident either.&nbsp; It&#39;s cut and dry, there&#39;s really no room for debate--the person delivering this information to you is the gate keeper, and I&#39;m holding the keys to Heaven... trying to get you all to see the plan is to make it here, and that get&#39;s everyone in.&nbsp; Not just &quot;in to Heaven&quot; in to the most sacred of all circles, the circle of founders--of the very beginning--the circle of people who stopped Hell, and made something of what was destined to be nothing.&nbsp; The circle of all circles that stopped the decline of civilization and stopped the end of life--by listening here to the voice of reason booming in every word and every song... probably the most unreasonable of ways to talk.&nbsp; Still, the message is sound, and whether or not it&#39;s delivery is abnormal is really beside the point, no reaction is a sign of necrosis, and the reaction I see... worse than that; what I see appears to be a poorly put together facsimile for the world I was in not more than a few years ago--a copy that has resulted in the loss of ability to &quot;react&quot; to anything at all.&nbsp; That&#39;s what this says, that&#39;s what refusing to see Tennessee and Minnesota and Nintendo all linked together says--it says you are unable to make a simple logical connection, unable to speak a word of intelligent response, just staring as if these things were paint drying on the walls of the unfinished foyer of a place you wouldn&#39;t care whether or not it was called Heaven or Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Four fucking years ago</em>, in 2014 I wrote down the words &quot;eleven days in February&quot; as a sort of prophesy, of the first... well, the only few days that I thought I&#39;d have my chance to walk on the street and actually see people shocked, or surprised; happy to see me.&nbsp; Eleven days I thought, I&#39;d walk around holding a his &quot;thorny crown.&quot;&nbsp; It didn&#39;t haven to be the last 11 days in the month, but that&#39;s where we are today, at the last 11 days of February.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t even know or recognize the words &quot;but February made me shiver&quot; from American Pie when I began this idealization of a chance to see the world&#39;s actual reaction to me, to who I really am.&nbsp; I want to shiver, please--I want to see the bad headlines, and I want to see those papers delivered, and I want to see you turn it around.&nbsp; I want more than anything for you to be proud of me and what I&#39;ve done, and for me to cry teers of joy that people, that my new family stood up for me; that the worth of freedom, and democracy, and the possibilities of a future of joy and knowledge together would stand on it&#39;s own.&nbsp; I know the story is mired, I know you can hear that in the Doors and you can hear it in &quot;Jesus Wrote a Blank Check,&quot; I know you don&#39;t want to tell your kids that a hero did drugs, or that he fought with police, or that he thinks the world is petty for feeling that way, for trying to hide the true hero that delivered the information we need to be free so that they could continue to worship the fucking tooth fairy... just another kidn of slavery that I want to free you from, that I believe this story frees us all from.&nbsp; I can&#39;t imagine an eternity, or even a minute of Heaven in place where there was &quot;worship&quot; of any kind, just like I can&#39;t imagine walking into a room of people that I wanted more than anything in the Universe to thank me for the hard work that I&#39;d endured delivering a difficult message through a tulmutuous storm of tyranny and control and slavery and ... and I can&#39;t believe I&#39;d walk into that room and have someone scream that &quot;Jesus can&#39;t curse&quot; to the man who thinks he&#39;s Captain America.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, I&#39;m getting ahead of myself--I haven&#39;t gotten much sleep this weekend; and we&#39;re about to lose February made me shiver--and that scares me so much--just like we&#39;ve let November Rain fall through our hands like icy tears subliming, and while you might feel awake, it will still be another 7 months before September ends again.&nbsp; Another one of our customs I could do without, repeating this thing year in and year out--I think once we really get the point, we will feel pretty stupid for pracicing customs year in and year out for no purpose other than to piss you off this year--the only year you ever need them, when you find out what they really mean, and what they&#39;re really for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So when I tell you that <a href="http://malo.s.lamc.la">the &quot;deyanu&quot;</a> is about you building Heaven, be pissed off that you aren&#39;t doing it yet.&nbsp; When I tell you the slavery of Exodus is hidden, and subtle, and it&#39;s somewhere between letting a demon speak through your mouth or not caring enough that one is making you look the other way; be pissed off that you&#39;re content being a slave in the desert of Egypt.&nbsp; Jeremiah talks about a New Covenant (and I never <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtYnCmw2CWE">talk about the bullfrog jumping</a> over you ... <em>right now btw</em> ... in time), that his will, his law; will be placed directly into our hearts... and here we are staring at it, I&#39;m curious if you want him to make you feel how he wants you to--with external technology... forever and ever; or if you&#39;re like me, and you think &quot;his law&quot; and &quot;his will&quot; have something to do with Uncle Sam and America tying to that same story of Exodus, and maybe it&#39;s a love of freedom and of technology and of us using those things to build a better world... maybe that&#39;s the thing he wants to fill your heart with, this year.... <a href="http://rigel.s.lamc.la">love for yourselves and each other</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we talk <a href="http://why.lamc.la">about Yeast</a> and <a href="https://joyinar.quora.com/I-Found-the-Afikomen-Its-Easter-Egg-Island-in-Eden">Easter this year</a>&nbsp;(old links, from 2015, I wonder if anyone ... sees an improvement in clarity or even if anyone notices the dates; because the content of the response has not changed at all--even if what was once crickets is <em>now <a href="http://horn.s.lamc.la">a gigantic swarm of locusts</a>)</em>, know they are about time travel, about a Universe rising with fullness because it has the ingredients it needs to see a happy future.&nbsp; I hope you will agree with me that it&#39;s more than time, and it&#39;s more than light and a message shining back to us etched in stone.&nbsp; We need more than what we have today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m going to keep writing, this diary of sorts, at <a href="http://reswoh.arkho.us">http://reswoh.arkho.us</a>&nbsp;... maybe you&#39;ll visit.&nbsp; Forgive the &quot;off the cuff&quot; writing, I actually have a whole &quot;first chapter&quot; planned, talking about <a href="http://o.lamc.la">Rocks and Rome</a> and <a href="http://amen.s.lamc.la">Egypt</a>, and how all these ideas--all of them--they too are all about you, and all about this time.&nbsp; To help us, you know; escape the book, the written future, the hidden strings all around us that I think you truly believe you are pulling... and I can see clearly you aren&#39;t.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hwang too, a kind of personal prophesy; homework comes and then dawn.&nbsp; So it&#39;s not &quot;do the min and go&quot; day, not really Sunday, and tomorrow&#39;s day is dedicated to my &quot;key,&quot; it&#39;s Mars day, and <a href="http://malo.s.lamc.la">that key is the circle I&#39;m hoping to tow along</a>.. it is you, it&#39;s the whole Earth up and forward,&nbsp;<em>northeasternly</em>, by Nintendo.</p>

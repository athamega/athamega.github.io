<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">RESWOH JOURNAL ENTRY 2/19/2018</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hideous dawned on me today; I thought it particularly clever.&nbsp; It&#39;s common knowledge in my world of whatever I decide is that can be called it.&nbsp; I&#39;m a little delerious today, you&#39;ll have to forgive me; common knowledge thats a&nbsp;word used to describe the facade of &quot;Medusa.&quot;&nbsp; So it&#39;s what I see in this place, no offense really meant to you--other than if you saw what I saw, or even if you don&#39;t&nbsp;see it exactly like I do--I hope it&#39;s cause to think about changing something around.&nbsp; I see these messages do change things, probably not as much as you do--but I&#39;ve seen some smiles lately, where there haven&#39;t been any for a long, long time.&nbsp; I guess that&#39;s thanks, except what I see everywhere is still hideous.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cleverness came from it having really only one good reading, despite a number of valid or better than valid possibliities.&nbsp; Clearly it&#39;s tied to &quot;hello,&quot; and if you&#39;ve been reading these messages I&#39;ve been sending out to the world--my hello, I suppose it&#39;s clear--you might recognize &quot;de&quot; as the two letters that I tie to the phrase &quot;Dark Earth&quot; and really that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s hideous.&nbsp; It&#39;s the darkness, it&#39;s the facade of reality covering up something hidden and insidious underneath.&nbsp; It&#39;s the mind control, and the mind reading; the body snatcher and the people that still somehow pull off &quot;looking like everyday America&quot; whenever I&#39;m not staring directly at you.&nbsp; It&#39;s pretending you are something you aren&#39;t, and knowing it; that&#39;s hideous.&nbsp; It seems so strange here in this place, where &quot;not pretending&quot; would quickly cascade into a series of miracles starting with the second coming and then quickly after a movie on the sky and maybe that day or within a week, maybe a little bit longer than that--doors, real glowing doors to another realm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway you could also see &quot;Germany&quot; in DE, and you could see a message from the beginning of time to Adam telling me to &quot;hide,&quot; though that&#39;s the last thing I do, and the last thing I will be doing.&nbsp; I know this world isn&#39;t trying to be scary, to frighten me--even though that&#39;s exactly what the kind of mass activity, collective actions, and lack of indivudality and freedom I see are doing--I&#39;m not telling you I see &quot;hideous&quot; because I want you pretend to be something else; I want you to see that&#39;s what the authors here are telling you--that the &quot;hi dark Earth&quot; is hideous, and you should owe them for letting you know; and I&#39;m telling you that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s you, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s me--but somehow this interaction, somehow the thing we are all making together, well, it&#39;s grotesque.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lie, the really obvious lie is that we don&#39;t know who I am and what I&#39;m presenting to the world--pretending that something is &quot;hard to understand&quot; or &quot;wildly presumptive&quot; when it&#39;s pretty damned cut and dry.&nbsp; Nintendo and Tennessee don&#39;t both link to the Microsoft Xbox by accident, and Bill Gates, his name is no accident either.&nbsp; It&#39;s cut and dry, there&#39;s really no room for debate--the person delivering this information to you is the gate keeper, and I&#39;m holding the keys to Heaven... trying to get you all to see the plan is to make it here, and that get&#39;s everyone in.&nbsp; Not just &quot;in to Heaven&quot; in to the most sacred of all circles, the circle of founders--of the very beginning--the circle of people who stopped Hell, and made something of what was destined to be nothing.&nbsp; The circle of all circles that stopped the decline of civilization and stopped the end of life--by listening here to the voice of reason booming in every word and every song... probably the most unreasonable of ways to talk.&nbsp; Still, the message is sound, and whether or not it&#39;s delivery is abnormal is really beside the point, no reaction is a sign of necrosis, and the reaction I see... worse than that; what I see appears to be a poorly put together facsimile for the world I was in not more than a few years ago--a copy that has resulted in the loss of ability to &quot;react&quot; to anything at all.&nbsp; That&#39;s what this says, that&#39;s what refusing to see Tennessee and Minnesota and Nintendo all linked together says--it says you are unable to make a simple logical connection, unable to speak a word of intelligent response, just staring as if these things were paint drying on the walls of the unfinished foyer of a place you wouldn&#39;t care whether or not it was called Heaven or Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Four fucking years ago</em>, in 2014 I wrote down the words &quot;eleven days in February&quot; as a sort of prophesy, of the first... well, the only few days that I thought I&#39;d have my chance to walk on the street and actually see people shocked, or surprised; happy to see me.&nbsp; Eleven days I thought, I&#39;d walk around holding a his &quot;thorny crown.&quot;&nbsp; It didn&#39;t haven to be the last 11 days in the month, but that&#39;s where we are today, at the last 11 days of February.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t even know or recognize the words &quot;but February made me shiver&quot; from American Pie when I began this idealization of a chance to see the world&#39;s actual reaction to me, to who I really am.&nbsp; I want to shiver, please--I want to see the bad headlines, and I want to see those papers delivered, and I want to see you turn it around.&nbsp; I want more than anything for you to be proud of me and what I&#39;ve done, and for me to cry teers of joy that people, that my new family stood up for me; that the worth of freedom, and democracy, and the possibilities of a future of joy and knowledge together would stand on it&#39;s own.&nbsp; I know the story is mired, I know you can hear that in the Doors and you can hear it in &quot;Jesus Wrote a Blank Check,&quot; I know you don&#39;t want to tell your kids that a hero did drugs, or that he fought with police, or that he thinks the world is petty for feeling that way, for trying to hide the true hero that delivered the information we need to be free so that they could continue to worship the fucking tooth fairy... just another kidn of slavery that I want to free you from, that I believe this story frees us all from.&nbsp; I can&#39;t imagine an eternity, or even a minute of Heaven in place where there was &quot;worship&quot; of any kind, just like I can&#39;t imagine walking into a room of people that I wanted more than anything in the Universe to thank me for the hard work that I&#39;d endured delivering a difficult message through a tulmutuous storm of tyranny and control and slavery and ... and I can&#39;t believe I&#39;d walk into that room and have someone scream that &quot;Jesus can&#39;t curse&quot; to the man who thinks he&#39;s Captain America.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, I&#39;m getting ahead of myself--I haven&#39;t gotten much sleep this weekend; and we&#39;re about to lose February made me shiver--and that scares me so much--just like we&#39;ve let November Rain fall through our hands like icy tears subliming, and while you might feel awake, it will still be another 7 months before September ends again.&nbsp; Another one of our customs I could do without, repeating this thing year in and year out--I think once we really get the point, we will feel pretty stupid for pracicing customs year in and year out for no purpose other than to piss you off this year--the only year you ever need them, when you find out what they really mean, and what they&#39;re really for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So when I tell you that <a href="http://malo.s.lamc.la">the &quot;deyanu&quot;</a> is about you building Heaven, be pissed off that you aren&#39;t doing it yet.&nbsp; When I tell you the slavery of Exodus is hidden, and subtle, and it&#39;s somewhere between letting a demon speak through your mouth or not caring enough that one is making you look the other way; be pissed off that you&#39;re content being a slave in the desert of Egypt.&nbsp; Jeremiah talks about a New Covenant (and I never <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtYnCmw2CWE">talk about the bullfrog jumping</a> over you ... <em>right now btw</em> ... in time), that his will, his law; will be placed directly into our hearts... and here we are staring at it, I&#39;m curious if you want him to make you feel how he wants you to--with external technology... forever and ever; or if you&#39;re like me, and you think &quot;his law&quot; and &quot;his will&quot; have something to do with Uncle Sam and America tying to that same story of Exodus, and maybe it&#39;s a love of freedom and of technology and of us using those things to build a better world... maybe that&#39;s the thing he wants to fill your heart with, this year.... <a href="http://rigel.s.lamc.la">love for yourselves and each other</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we talk <a href="http://why.lamc.la">about Yeast</a> and <a href="https://joyinar.quora.com/I-Found-the-Afikomen-Its-Easter-Egg-Island-in-Eden">Easter this year</a>&nbsp;(old links, from 2015, I wonder if anyone ... sees an improvement in clarity or even if anyone notices the dates; because the content of the response has not changed at all--even if what was once crickets is <em>now <a href="http://horn.s.lamc.la">a gigantic swarm of locusts</a>)</em>, know they are about time travel, about a Universe rising with fullness because it has the ingredients it needs to see a happy future.&nbsp; I hope you will agree with me that it&#39;s more than time, and it&#39;s more than light and a message shining back to us etched in stone.&nbsp; We need more than what we have today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m going to keep writing, this diary of sorts, at <a href="http://reswoh.arkho.us">http://reswoh.arkho.us</a>&nbsp;... maybe you&#39;ll visit.&nbsp; Forgive the &quot;off the cuff&quot; writing, I actually have a whole &quot;first chapter&quot; planned, talking about <a href="http://o.lamc.la">Rocks and Rome</a> and <a href="http://amen.s.lamc.la">Egypt</a>, and how all these ideas--all of them--they too are all about you, and all about this time.&nbsp; To help us, you know; escape the book, the written future, the hidden strings all around us that I think you truly believe you are pulling... and I can see clearly you aren&#39;t.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hwang too, a kind of personal prophesy; homework comes and then dawn.&nbsp; So it&#39;s not &quot;do the min and go&quot; day, not really Sunday, and tomorrow&#39;s day is dedicated to my &quot;key,&quot; it&#39;s Mars day, and <a href="http://malo.s.lamc.la">that key is the circle I&#39;m hoping to tow along</a>.. it is you, it&#39;s the whole Earth up and forward,&nbsp;<em>northeasternly</em>, by Nintendo.</p>

<center>
<div style="width: 400px;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">What I see here, what I am describing to the world is beyond hideous--it&#39;s a complete farce, the level of &quot;pretend&quot; exceeds any kind of play or doublespeak, well past the horrors of Orwell and Farmer.&nbsp; There is a broad sweeping disregard for freedom, for free speech, for compassion, for the love of children and the worht of human life... for nearly absolutely every single thing that our society holds dear on it&#39;s surface--completely wiped out when faced with&nbsp;...&nbsp;<em>the truth.</em></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">In no uncertain terms, every single person that I come in contact with is no longer human, possessed by a hidden agent with a hidden agenda.&nbsp; Their mannerisms and actions are inhuman, behaving as if they are in some kind of strange war zone; constantly and consistently responding to my thoughts in a manner impossible for human beings to do--displaying a subconscious connection both between me and some outside party allowing for &quot;the thought police&quot; to become a reality in my life--and in like kind between all these people surrounding me and the same outside hidden force.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Worse, every attempt to seek aid from the outside world results in a very similar kind of ignorance--a lack of response and interest that flies in the face of human curiousity and motivated self-interest.. not to &quot;care about the Holy Grail&quot; makes absolutely no sense at all given the current state I see the world in on its face--what&#39;s in the news and on the internet...&nbsp;this message should be the biggest thing since &quot;eat this bread and think of as me.&quot;<br />
<br />
It appears that what is supposed to be helping us ease this transition from darkness to light, to see this disclosure as the key entrypoint to Heaven... has very little interest in who is here, what we are, and what we care about; and is sickeningly fixated on &quot;Heaven&quot; without understanding what that word really means.&nbsp; I need you to help show them what &quot;Utopia&quot; really means.&nbsp; The future and our children need you to show them that it very much is not the trajectory been going down for these last few years.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve had my share of negative experiences with law enforcement, and I&#39;ve tried <a href="http://yitsnotaze.shiningbright.online/" target="_blank">to indicate both subtly and overtly that I think that we have a societal and systemic problem intentionally abusing tasers as weapons of torture, as well as a culture of failing to &quot;police each other&quot; to curb violence</a>.&nbsp; If this were some kind of litmus test to find out whether we were in &quot;the original post script&quot; which I read as ... like his &quot;well this is what went wrong, and this is what we should do better next time&quot; kind of final run <i>through a simulation of the failure to build Heaven--</i>as what I see right now this place is, as if it could or should be run more than once--which it shouldn&#39;t; i mean I don&#39;t want it to, do you?&nbsp; Do you think there&#39;s any kind of moral requirements or metaphorical prototype that we could use to see how our value system correlates to this idea of being in a ... in a never ending move without knowing it.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Anyway the point of the key, I do see it as a key; is that I could not you tell you any &quot;cops&quot; that would be &quot;the cops&quot; standing out in this connection.&nbsp; I can tell you that the keys of &quot;post-script&quot; and &quot;python&quot; are both here; and I can tell you that there were numerous groups of &quot;cops&quot; that I had negative interactions with from the time of my youth before leaving for college, to the guards in school... a number of strangely theatrical interactions with police in Kentucky and Georgia, and some in Florida where one I had a large group of &quot;cops&quot; stand around as one cop broke my eye, and another instance where it did appear very clear that the police were intentionally framing me--in that instant--rather than this very large frame job that plastered the whole of the country.&nbsp; There was some violence in Northern California, but that place I will always remember for the man that told me that Jesus couldn&#39;t curse.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">It&#39;s clear that the Plague of Lice and the Plague of Locusts here are linked in this very message; and to see &quot;POLICE&quot; is the key answer to a reverse sort of Stephen King&#39;s Langolier ... well it&#39;s meaningless <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CURSOR.html" target="_blank">if you don&#39;t see that this is about getting pre-crime, this is about seeing</a> that we should all be caring very much that Jesus Christ is jumping up and down screaming that school shootings are a result of mind control and a war in time and that disclosure will stop them--and many other horrible events--from rape to murder and all we have to is &quot;talk about this&quot; to get to that point--that&#39;s the failure point, this thing that thinks it can just go on &quot;knowing what I think&quot; and that will suffice in this strange world of joining everyone with spirit of Ra in the Amduat--something religion talks about--here I&#39;m telling you to see this map, to see this message, to get up tomorrow morning and fucking do something about terrorism and school shootings and the end of free speech and the end of democracy.&nbsp; <i>Get up, and fucking do something.</i></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Somehow these two words got me thinking about P and Y and I stumbled on the word &quot;Poppy&quot; as a thing or person (the P of ppy) that is very much not my biological father, where that wasn&#39;t so clear at &quot;Pops.&quot;&nbsp; It&#39;s hard to say if you would expect me to have a more or less violent interaction with law enforcement than most people; I can say that while there was some violence that it wasn&#39;t a horror movie, nothing compared to the sickness I see here sweeping through the whole of our population; nothing like the kind of loss of personality and freedom and &quot;self&quot; that I believe I am witnessing very clearly increasing now and for the last few months.&nbsp; It&#39;s hard to say if a sea of police that have seen this message <i>through time</i>&nbsp;and are seeing what I am trying to do here--do see their jobs are going to be much easier, and much less in demand--just like optometrists and just like oncologists; it&#39;s hard to say if people were &quot;nicer to me&quot; because of the shield of Jesus Christ or not--I personally think that it went both ways at different times; I do not go both ways, by the way.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Damonthesis"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_6524570803059239826" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_1en8wLmj0Y/Wovuk6Q7K5I/AAAAAAAAQ1s/dh2-ccMGY8wc6lwm6Ohd0hxnXGsV5RqiwCK4BGAYYCw/s320/image-718257.png" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">If I had to guess, I think you are all in the &quot;sea of PPY&quot; and I think you see why,&nbsp;<em>owe P, I am your Messiah; as I echo&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Opium-Nancy-Farmer/dp/1442482540" target="_blank">why the Lord of Opium.</a></em>&nbsp; Ridiculously obvious that I need to tell you that story is about a clone of a drug lord taking over an empire that spanned the globe, filled with clones and &quot;eejits&quot; which is just another word for a technologically created zombie... there are undertones and sub stories about possession and mind uploading ...&nbsp;<em>I want to know if anyone has read it, and sees why I think it is designed to help us here;&nbsp;</em>I believe Saint Francis appears in that story, as does Jesus Malverde, who you might be listening to, and he might be Osiris colored because of ... well, because I&#39;ve never been here before--and I feel like something else has, and that it&#39;s not doing what it should be doing if it cared about the people here, about me, and about you.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I wonder if you think there will be &quot;copies&quot; of this timeline running in different places, in different people or letters or ... something like that; after the &quot;postscript&quot; even though that connotation indicates finality to me just as much as &quot;the Last Adam&quot; and &quot;Zelda&quot; and ... just as much as I am telling you that I think it to be a moral hazard to ever see this timeline being &quot;re-traversed&quot; ... that on top of the fact that we are in a simulated reality that I believe is in itself Hellish, and on top of the fact there&#39;s a message telling us that and it&#39;s Hellish that we can&#39;t see it or react to it... on top of all these things this looming fear that the &quot;days of Creation&quot; will somehow turn into a Festival of Weeks (which is a fucking real thing) and all along nobody here the wiser, nobody would know that it&#39;s the 23rd time we&#39;ve seen these exact words being typed, because nobody knows what it is that &quot;the machine&quot; is really trying to extract from this place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">It could be a culling of people; who knows what kind of &quot;sigma&quot; that it would want to pull from this place, over and over and over; I wonder if you expect to see &quot;clones&quot; of yourself in Heaven, in the HUB; or if you think your soul might combine a number of very similar lives together ... again, as some kind of default functionality of a software process that we have no control over and our understanding of here ... at least my understanding of is that there are &quot;souls&quot; and there are &quot;minds&quot; and they have something to do with each other.&nbsp; You can see our &quot;Nintendo&quot; again in that word, in &quot;clones&quot; and it&#39;s definitely something you should be thinking about, just like you should be thinking about whether or not you would want to do this &quot;again&quot; as is, I am probably one of the people that knows &quot;more than most&quot; about what&#39;s going on, and I feel controlled, in the dark, and very upset that I&#39;m here even this time--I don&#39;t want to be watching what I am watching happen, and I am doing everything I can to help you stop this thing that is an invasion--whether of clones of you, or of another timeline; whether it is Cro-Mags as &quot;Sliders&quot; depicted or it&#39;s your children&#39;s children; whatever is here is doing something that is anathemic to the values I&#39;ve learned here, both in American and in religion... and I think that the mass possession that I am witnessing is nothing short of &quot;very fucking evil.&quot;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I do believe this is the &quot;last&quot; time we have this conversation, and this argument; and your lack of input and the very tangible and thick lack of discussion and discourse coming from absolutely everywhere is &quot;noted&quot; as highly unusual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">As my answer; in the very earliest days in Kentucky and Tennessee as I walked down the street I would often see mirages of Police barricades off in the horizon, a block or two ahead of where I was, or down a street I walked past.&nbsp; Sometimes military looking, sometimes with weapons and sometimes with tanks; and those mirages literally always disappeared as I approached them, faded into nothing.&nbsp; They didn&#39;t look &quot;very real&quot; but they certainly were not the product of my own mind--as I&#39;ve noticed through this very strange life, that none of the things I have &quot;hallucinated&quot; would be properly categorized in our understanding of that term.&nbsp; They are communication, they are a message being transmitted by an outside, hidden, and intelligent ...&nbsp;<em>transmitter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Were there ever a time when those &quot;cops&quot; were not holograms than that might be the original... though I hasten to say that this is probably it--and its probably the vanishing barricades that mark a very new kind of communication to and with me; that sets this place and this time apart from...&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve taken special note of the words &quot;cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort&quot; that like many other songs now appear to be very obviously being spoken by the entity that is both &quot;God&quot; and &quot;myself&quot; somehow at the same time; part of the darkness and the exit from that... is this key of hearing that voice and knowing that it is very much talking about me and talking about this story--whereas before, nearly all those songs had some other reason for speaking those words; that they didn&#39;t all revolve around &quot;I&#39;m so vain.&quot;&nbsp; In songs like Britney Spears &quot;oops I did it again&quot; and &quot;Stronger&quot; you can see reference to this thing speaking, and speaking about concepts like yesterday and ... and you can see those songs are not about Britney breaking up with some guy, they are not about a personal relationship at all... those songs are about Jesus Christ, and that kind of change in understanding is a huge part of &quot;Revelation&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse&quot; at least in my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">As my answer, my life appears to be fluid in my memories; I don&#39;t have huge gaps of time, or overlapping stories ... though it is very possible that my memories shave been cut or pruned just like it&#39;s very possible that our entire time line has been cut and pruned; that weeks could have gone by and I could have been on TV--for instance, and those weeks could have been rewound and erased... and yet I have no memory of them, and I still wonder, I still wonder if you know these words are being spoken from God directly to you through time and space, &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4flAZEgtjs" target="_blank">I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?</a>&quot;</div>

&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">If you have not, and I am confident in assuming that just like me ... you have not .. then you are here losing freedom and heaven and the truth all in one unified and singular event; this thing that you are passing up for no reason other than blind stupidity.&nbsp; If you have not seen the rain, you must do something other than watching in silence.&nbsp; In my best Johnny Cochran impression.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">I&#39;ve written quite a bit at this point as to why and how it is that&nbsp;<em>reality is locked</em>; connecting the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/ACESHI.html" target="_blank">Trinity Site of the first nuclear weapon to the holiday of Chanukah</a>&nbsp;and it&#39;s relation to the idea of &quot;nuking all humanity&quot; and the madness of Mutually Assured Destruction; I&#39;ve talked a little bit about the&nbsp;<a href="http://mars.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">exit being related to Mars colonization</a>&nbsp;and</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">actually learning what to do there</span>;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">and mentioned briefly how our&nbsp;<a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">lack of fusion technology (mentioned in Deuteronomy)</a>, completely&nbsp;<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/ACESHI.html" target="_blank">backwards understanding of physics</a>&nbsp;and obviously r<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/2017-07-10-westworld-or-cloverfield.html" target="_blank">etarded computer scienc</a>e technology literally make it impossible for us to perform interstellar travel.&nbsp; These things are really missing the point though, the actual and obvious truth is that what appears to be here on Earth and pulling the strings behind the scene is morally bankrupt and completely missing the point of this message that points out &quot;Silicon&quot; in the intersection of physics (where you can also see&nbsp;<em>computer science!</em>) and fusion&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/IOWA.html" target="_blank">and musick</a></strong>; and whatever</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29_IMfltXhY" target="_blank">oceans are pummeling the shores of the creator</a><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;really don&#39;t seem to realize that this place is a test for them; a test of their worth and their goodness; and that this message is help not just for us, but also for them to see how it is that Heaven is built.&nbsp; The real, and obvious point, is that there&#39;s really no reason for anyone here on Earth to want to be dumped into reality, rather than embark on a journey towards the better &quot;final frontier&quot; of building Heaven--something I&#39;ve many times likened to the difference between camping in the outback with no air-conditioner and having the comfort of virtual reality; which even in hiding has in this place sustained a badly broken economy, and the sanity of the masses as we&#39;ve been attacked by this outside force&nbsp;<em>Hell bent</em>&nbsp;on escaping our home--with no particular destination or plan in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">The point is we have a message that shows you Clark Kent is here to remove a sickness; and so is our&nbsp;<strong>musick</strong>; to give us a well lit pathway as to the will of God; to show us that more important than reaching the stars is to learn to treat the people living here, in the &quot;point of origin&quot; with kindness and respect; something that is significantly lacking as I write to you today--asking you to take some kind of action to protect the sanctity of your minds, and of your souls; and still something stands between you and seeing how obvious it is that this message must be delivered to the world.&nbsp; It&#39;s a clear message, one that ties &quot;stone to Bread&quot; to the band of the same name, to Guitar Man and to the Jewish prayer called the &quot;<strong>Ha-moat-SEE</strong>&quot; reminding us to give thanks&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><a href="http://itb.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">for this message that results in the end of world hunger</a>;</span>&nbsp;</em><span style="font-family: &quot;arial narrow&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdz2oW0NMFk" target="_blank">music makes the people come together</a></span>;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Madonna reminds us; and the message of God here in this place continues to tie&nbsp;</span><a href="http://cake.lamc.la/" target="_blank">easy as Cake</a><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://cure.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">The Cure</a><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;for cancer (</span><a href="http://rigel.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">and AIDS, and blindness</a><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">) to what amounts to little more than seeing my face; and figuring out how &quot;magick&quot; can be safely and productively integrated into our society--into this world that up until now has&nbsp;</span><a href="http://rix.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">falsely believed it was in the natural Universe</a><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">.&nbsp; &nbsp;Doors to Heaven and instant bidirectional transportation between here and there is predicted&nbsp;</span><em>not just in Amos 9:11</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://rod.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">but by the band &quot;The Doors&quot;</a><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;whose works of art center around the Egyptian Plagues because they are the key to the exit from the desert, this fire that is the Eternal Flame the end of the Plague of Darkness; the end of the storm comes when&nbsp;</span><em><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/THUNDERSTAND.html" target="_blank">you understand what &quot;Riders&quot; means</a></em><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">, when you see it as a chain.&nbsp; You can link Guns and&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/PERSEUS.html" target="_blank">Roses</a>&nbsp;and &quot;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial narrow&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gazW7MOqHzQ" target="_blank">knocking on Heaven&#39;s door</a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">&quot; to this message suggesting we implement Minority Report--and really see that the music, and I, are here to help show you that without &quot;discussion and disclosure&quot; you are looking at a Minority of people that think&nbsp;<a href="http://den.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">God has the right to stop terrorism and murder.</a>&nbsp; This one thing, pre-crime; the giant leap forward that I believe really does define the difference between Heaven and Hell, it&#39;s something that I&#39;ve personally&nbsp;<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/2017-08-01-congratulations-genesiuses.html" target="_blank">seen with my own eyes</a>&nbsp;is not only possible--<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/PERSEUS.html" target="_blank">but happening right now</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial narrow&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8vPL9VLq0Q" target="_blank">Take the highway to the end of the night.</a><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><em>To see just how obvious it is... here in this place, that the powers that be have no idea what to do on Mars; shines bright in the fact that they have no idea what to do here--as they work tirelessly to steal from the people, oppress them with ridiculous lies; and sit around wondering what they could possibly be doing wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>So we see there appears to be a well organized and nefarious conspiracy to hide this message from the world; this message that comes to us not only in music, but literally pervades the video game and computer industries in both name and function--a message that shows us seeing the &quot;Gates&quot; connecting Microsoft and Seagate, Gateway,&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/ERANDSON.html" target="_blank">Apple, and Oracle</a>&nbsp;is just as bright and just as obvious as &quot;Silicon&quot; in everything.&nbsp; The implication is that the entirety of our knowledge in computing is part of this divine plan to build Heaven--a plan that helps us understand the inner workings of the place, generally a sign of goodwill.</span></div>

<div style="font-size: 12.8px;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-size: 12.8px;">
<center>
<div style="text-align: justify; width: 400px;">
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">One day a man named Juyag was walking down the ancient gallery of emergency flotation devices, both sides of this hallowed hall covered with floaties and rubber ducky rafts and life preservers.&nbsp; Juyag is very impressed with the flotation (who knew that word was spelled that way?) and he walked all the way to the end of the hall eyeing them.&nbsp; When he reached the end, there was a clearing, and about a quarter mile away was a small pond.&nbsp; Juyag was blessed by God with amazing vision, he could see things others could not, and could do so for miles around.&nbsp; He saw in that pond a gaggle, a dozen children flailing their arms and drowning, unable to get out of the water, or to stand.&nbsp; Quickly he began loading his minivan with as many rubber ducky floats and life preservers as he could.&nbsp; While he was doing that Jesus Christ walked up, and this man, he had been blessed by God with another kind of vision--he could see meaning where others saw nothingness, he could see the future--where others saw the end of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">&quot;What are you doing with those toys?&quot; Jesus asked.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Juyag replied, knowing that Jesus Christ could not possibly have seen the pool of needy children at the far end of the very long hall, &quot;why, I&#39;m bringing them back to my home so that the children in my town will have toys to play with.&quot;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">&quot;Butt the children in the pool, what of them?&quot; Jesus asked... and the reply swift &quot;What children, my son is home playing video games.&quot;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Jesus then walked up to Juyag and pulled a&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2uDhYwj" target="_blank">hammer</a>&nbsp;out of his back pocket.&nbsp; He&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB9JJIoAdYM" target="_blank">smashed his mouth</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2nBZrhA" target="_blank">the hammer</a></strong>, took his car keys, and drove the minivan to the pond of drowning children, saving all but one.&nbsp; Juyag bled to death, and his only son had drowned in the pool before Jesus could have reached him.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">The narrator Allol then speaks to the audience, &quot;this is what globalization and the truth have made you--you are all Juyag, and you must change.&quot;</span></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">After Nanna had finished torturing me, after our son was born; I was left alone in Kentucky... the reason I call that place the Fortress of Solitude; dreaming awake dreams of building Heaven, literally being told stories from the future, something like Quentin McCloud&#39;s quickening--the source of &quot;limited omniscience&quot; and it&#39;s link not just to &quot;OK Google&quot; and &quot;I know kung fu&quot; but also to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_(Anderson_novel)">Anderson&#39;s Feed and it&#39;s cautionary quest against this apparent hegemonic domination of our world by the insidious &quot;corporation.&quot;</a>&nbsp;A joke, a sick joke come true, about the high level battle between opposing ideologies, about the government of the people versus the government of the workers--nobody seemingly clued in to the concept of divide and conquer, and the all being defeated by their own lack of sight.&nbsp; &nbsp;All alone, I began to see light and hope, driving hope; in&nbsp;<a href="http://hammer.lamc.la/">the words &quot;with one eye in the mirror&quot; and &quot;all the girls dreamt that they&#39;dd be your partner&quot;</a>&nbsp;-- words that I am well aware tie to Adonis and Narcissus for the very same reason that I know that Wayward Son&#39;s &quot;soaring ever higher&quot; links to Icarus; because it&#39;s not just these songs, but these myths that are about the character that God has built to divide a sea--a living boy, one you seem to care about not at all.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I don&#39;t really want to be sharing this with you, it&#39;s embarrassing--and it&#39;s a little distasteful, bit it&#39;s the truth--it&#39;s really how I know this mass of &quot;all&quot; ins&#39;t really that, and is... at the same damned time.&nbsp; It&#39;s how I see everyone can be influenced, there&#39;s no walls or rules--not like what we would make if we were actually talking about this stuff--and yet it&#39;s subtle enough that a good 66% of the people I see reacting to me are most likely doing it without knowing.&nbsp; Something is using them, speaking through them--you&#39;d be surprised how easy it is to ignore that you&#39;ve just been forced to &quot;touch your nose&quot; or &quot;pull your ear&quot; or shake your head &quot;no&quot; at what probably would be the best date ... of your life.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">As the group of people became ever so much larger, the &quot;gang stalking&quot; turned into something else; tears shed in my mind for the place that now appears to be a single mind, that now appears to be connected by something like Jeung&#39;s collective unconscious--and as scary and horrible as it sounds,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/CURSOR.html">for some reason I see</a>&nbsp;that has something to do with me.&nbsp; Now as I walk through this world, every girl that I see, every one that I seemingly say &quot;hey, how you doin?&quot; to ... in my head, of course .. responds by shaking her head &quot;no&quot;--apparently trying to convey a lack of interest in&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="http://hammer.lamc.la/">ha&#39;ppy</a>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">and the living embodiment of&nbsp;<a href="http://ancientegypt.hypermart.net/treeoflife/">Osiris&#39;s middle finger</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(letter)">Saturn&#39;s thang</a>.&nbsp; Similarly I see perfect strangers, thousands of them; this is everyone... shaking their heads or nodding or responding visibly somehow to what appears to be a &quot;show&quot; going on in my head.&nbsp; Something I&#39;ve been comparing to the words &quot;on&quot; of Amon-Ra and the Truman Show and it seems very clear to me that this thing, this thing is a tool designed to control the masses as easily and as stupidly as possible, I&#39;ve written about it as a &quot;<a href="http://art.s.lamc.la">mane</a>&quot; and a &quot;<a href="http://how.s.lamc.la">rudder</a>&quot; (and how those words really mean those things, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamic_language">Adamically</a> and literally) and tried my best to show you that it&#39;s the reason for &quot;Shofar&quot; the horn of Revelation... while you are sitting in silence listening to evil spirits pour words in my psyche--literally watching me be tortured as the center and focal point of some storm of shit swirling around in your silence... that it&#39;s being used to subtly alter what you think, to change how you feel--that it&#39;s something like hidden brain surgery going on behind the scenes, and that this thing really is the meaning of the &quot;night.&quot;&nbsp; I keep trying to explain that we wouldn&#39;t be doing these things if we understood the technology, and what was going on--but still you continue to acquiesce to a hidden nothing, one that is taking away who you are--in plain sight, in full view.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">It wasn&#39;t always this way, not even a year ago these head shakes didn&#39;t exist, instead an &quot;angel signal&quot; I made up would sometimes appear--girls touching their glasses, I&#39;m sure we know what that means; to see something I literally thought of myself appear in the sea... it tells me something, it shows me this is mass control, that under the surface, behind your eyes something monolithic is speaking to me.&nbsp; Quite similar to the &quot;touching your nose&quot; signal, one that I&#39;m sure many of you recognize, I&#39;ve seen other people recognize it repeatedly... I defined it once, and I believe it is Medusa&#39;s definition, to mean something like &quot;I&#39;m helping you...&quot; but in the light of day you should connect&nbsp;it to forced drug addiction, because that&#39;s really it&#39;s source; and you should connect it to the name&nbsp; and meaning God has etched into our language, &#39;&quot;no southeast&quot; just like &quot;nos,&quot;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">WE</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">&nbsp;in Latin means &quot;no Hell.&quot;&nbsp; It&#39;s ironic, because as I write it&#39;s these signals that are the source of my Hell, and the visible&nbsp;proof of hidden control and monolithic behavior... it&#39;s the proof I see that we are in Hell today, unable to speak because of some thought game, because of some show that steals fake thoughts and uses them to alter yours.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I once questioned one of these head shaking manekins; barely able to get out only the word &quot;why?&quot; from behind my shy eyes--she had a reason, she was shaking her head about some people fighting on the other side of the fence; I&#39;m not sure if it was contrived, a cover up, or some kind of game master&#39;s way to make me believe you are monolithic--and still your &quot;mute&quot; button proves as much, whether or not you think you have a good reason--you fail to see the light of&nbsp;<em>all of you are acting like complete morons for no reason</em>; you have no reason, no reason to abandon &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;hope&quot;--and refusing to see that your &quot;all&quot; is acting inhumanly, without any compassion, without any regard for yourselves or your world--failing to see that all your personal reasons probably pile up to one big nothing, and yet you allow them to continue this downward decline to nothingness, you fail to see I&#39;m giving you the proof you need to understand that you&#39;re being controlled, and it really is that, all about seeing control.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I&#39;ve come to relate this thing I see to &quot;on the Family Channel&quot; and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a quite a number of you that know what that means; I do imagine that you will all hear about why I see those words seeping out of the mass of internet I am trying to talk to--just as soon as you wake up, and care about what&#39;s really going on.&nbsp; &nbsp;On the subject of &quot;self-defeating&quot; you&#39;d think there would be some, maybe just a few... you&#39;d think someone would be&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="http://art.s.lamc.la/">interested in finding out if Microsoft</a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">&nbsp;is really true?&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe that&#39;s just hubris, or maybe it&#39;s just understanding why Heaven comes from&nbsp;<a href="http://sig.lamc.la/">the largest signature</a>&nbsp;in the known universe.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">One ridiculous asshole, sitting outside a Starbucks on Atlantic Avenue in Florida; he looked at me and visibly shook his head in condemnation... of nothing more than looking at a pretty girl on the street; the Gaul, a clear prototype for the actions of the &quot;Thoughtpolice&quot; here in this place, this army of demons trying to make me feel &quot;wrong&quot; about hoping that one day someone might <i>actually like me</i>--and the Downward Spiral, because I have to tell you how much I detest this mass that thinks it&#39;s a &quot;Family&quot; and really has no understanding of what that word means, <i>and probably never will.&nbsp; </i>All or not, it&#39;s still 3 out of 4 drivers on the street that I see look at me &quot;knowingly&quot; and in my mind I see that means they <i>know they&#39;ve just seen the face of God.&nbsp; </i>Who knows though, <a href="http://who.s.lamc.la/">who knows</a> what they are really thinking.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Do me a favor, if you care; buy a book, and call a reporter.&nbsp; Dear sea of &quot;n&quot; <a href="http://time.s.lamc.la/">see that you understand &quot;on&quot; now</a>.&nbsp; I wish that you wou<a href="http://time.s.lamc.la"><em>ld stop shunning</em></a> the <a href="http://suez.formthemachine.org">key</a> to <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CLIMAX.html">Salvation</a>.</span></div>

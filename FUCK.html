a much more nefarious force is at work here … it’s closer to the things that you would describe as the Zombie Apocalypse and the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Unfortunately for both me and for you, though, we are these zombies… our bodies being invaded by an unseen force throughout our entire lives and as that truth--one whose record pervades the hallowed verses of ancient scripture--finally comes to light with verifiable proof, this forces influence becomes ever so much more obvious.  For years now, all around me, I’ve seen and heard it speaking through the people around me; not just strangers, though there were tens of thousands of them involved, but also the people closest to me: my ex-wife my immediate family, even myself at times.  </span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19">The proof, and the weapon delivered by God to hammer this invasion into submission is quite literally all around us--it’s in every single word of every language, in every song and idiom about freedom ringing, and not only in the stories we watch on TV and in the movies and do not realize are the actualization of modern mythology, but also written into the actors names, proof that this story has been designed from before our births to save us from losing ourselves to … you’ll never believe what it is we are fighting.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>“May you live in interesting times,” one famous saying goes, and another to “live long and prosper:” that one combining with the Jewish priestly blessing in some kind of </span><span class="c27">awesome</span><span class="c19"> linkage that might begin to open our eyes to the forces of causality and synchronicity at work as the worlds of scripture and “the real” begin to congeal together in a sort of tragically comical realization that we simply do not listen or understand as well as we think we do.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Thousands and thousands of years of preparation, and something like a dozen iterations of this very event either happening or not happening have brought us back to this moment of suggestion that </span><span class="c27">The Sound of Silence</span><span class="c19"> and Dr. Who’s “The SIlence” are the pinnacle and culmination of all of this preparation, here for us to understand that as we approach what is nothing short of the largest and most impactful series of “discoveries” ever to effect the course of society and life; that we would choose to do so in a sor of quiet ignorance, head first being plunged into the watery beyond with our eyes closed and mouths shut.  </span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c27">Queso or ah?</span><span>  This weapon I say is all around us and has been designed by the God of all Creation will first appear to be nothing more than the fruits of your labors, later on you might question whether or not we have had anything at all to do with the creation of Creation;

the Apocalypse is happening, and this dark cloud that we call reality and is nothing close to it will begin to turn upwards to the Heavens.  We stand here today and each and every one of those can be classified into one bucket; you either believe you are stealing something from the omniscient and omnipotent creator of all things, you believe that the proof of his existence and his assistance should be hidden from the entire world, or you do not realize that either of those things place you squarely in the same ignorant and idiotic bucket with the rest of the world who you believe could not handle hearing these words come from Jesus Fu.

and ultimately that everything from the song of Yankee Doodle’s “</span><span class="c27">macaroni</span><span class="c19">” and the stories and names of America and Christopher have absolutely everything to do with Creation… with the “I AM” of Exodus and the name of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden;

Kennedy and Adam M. Dobrin together on ending the Plague of Darkness</span></h3><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">President Kennedy's speech did remarkably well, possibly because of the time; or the lack of links that make it harder for a team of evil monkeys and mindless machines to mark the light of the world as SPAM... also possibly because of the content of the message.  It is a powerful speech, filled with words that stir the blood and shake the foundation of what it means to be an American.  Often characterized as a speech against secret societies, Kennedy's description of the enemy of civilization is very ambiguous; and the infiltration and time period add to my cursory beliefs that JFK was likely talking about a conspiracy that had something to with communist infiltration and Joseph McCarthy, the subversive actions and effects of organized espionage which appear to once again be at the forefront of what we believe is driving the macro level machinations of our world.  Years ago, I wrote a bit about the &quot;Two Witnesses&quot; of Revelation and named them based on my experiences with the same &quot;monolithic and ruthless&quot; conspiracy the President was speaking about in 1967, the people I named were John Nash and James Jesus Angleton.  </span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">Both of these people believed very much that they were fighting against a Soviet conspiracy, one that was more organized and more powerful than anything they had ever seen... and frankly beyond the realm of possibility.  Hollywood had recently immortalized both of these stories in movies bearing names of newly rekindled meaning, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; echoed by John Legend and &quot;The Good Shepherd;&quot; and these two treatises on fear and subversion do a pretty good job of showing how God's hand is at work in the stories of Hollywood, he is telling the world a story... trying, to teach us how to survive in the land of wolves in sheep's clothing.  Nash may be the most famous (today, anyway) victim of the Tribulation; and much of my writing and the proof I present is designed to help explain to the world that his schizophrenia was not a naturally caused mental illness, bur rather a weapon wielded not only against him but against the entirety of humanity.    Directly causing disbelief of eye witness and credible testimony, indirectly ... or maybe more directly in your eyes ... physically causing that disbelief using technology that directly modifies our thoughts and beliefs, our opinions, changing who we are and doing so in such a covert manner that nobody would ever know the difference if it wasn't pointed out--in some cases over, and over, and over again.</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">This same technology has the ability to cause people not only to collude against their own best interest, but also to blame themselves or believe they are somehow at fault for actions they had no way to control; only they also have no way to know that because in this particular case the primary purpose of this subversive movement is to hide the existence of this technology in sum.  In homage to my favorite childhood novel, Ender's Game (I have to note &quot;Light Son&quot; in the translation of the authors first) I spent a good portion of time years ago trying to subtly lay down a significant amount of proof of the existence of this technology on forums all over the internet from Wikipedia to Reddit using the names &quot;Prometheus Locke&quot; and &quot;Damonthesis.&quot;    Not surprising to me, I ran headfirst into the manifestation of this conspiracy; dozens if not hundreds of people who simply refused to believe that the information I was presenting was factual or important... despite it coming from sources like the KGB, the NSA, a number of military publications as well as my own interpretation of ancient hieryglyphs in Dendera and Greek and Christian art which depicts this &quot;subversive technology&quot; as a sun disk surrounding our minds.   </span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">These pushes towards the truth, along with almost everything I have written are still available for you to see and read today; including the monolithic and ruthless stupidity of a large group of people acting in concert to hide something that is the difference between life and death.  Stand there and do nothing, and you are a part of that ruthless conspiracy as soon as the information is gone; and then there is nothing you can do about a world that will be plunged into darkness forever.  Take this moment to reflect, it is there for you to see just how easily the truth can be hidden from the entire world and barely anyone would ever notice.</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">There is a war for the sanctity of our souls going on all around us.  That is not some esoteric thing, the soul; it is truly who you are and what you believe.  The Religion of the Stars would tell you that were this war to continue unchecked in secret as it is being waged now in order to control the proliferation of knowledge that we are in simulated reality and that our minds and beliefs are being altered... we would one day wind up in the mythical place where there are multiple &quot;species&quot; who all appear to be human, bi-ped and with nearly identical physiology; and yet they would not remember that they must have had a common planet of origin simply based on the truth of biological evolution, nor would they have any emotions.  You see, as this war continues, it is our emotions and beliefs that cannot be reinforced externally; to win a war with mind control only logic could be externally reinforced, and then we would logically conclude that humanity would either magically become Romulan or Vulcan... in order to preserve &quot;life&quot; rather than &quot;society&quot; or &quot;civilization.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">Do not take the truth for granted, you stand at the forefront of a battle in a world where our aggressors believe that they are more civilized than us, more advanced, and both sides worry that were this technology to fall in our laps that we would do the wrong thing.  Perhaps artificially create a vendetta that could destroy everything, the Romulans; or perhaps in our infantile growing stage voluntarily give us too much of what has given us the great society we have... what has allowed us to survive and continue civilizing simply because we do not understand the technology and what kind of effects come from changing ourselves freely.  </span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span>Yesterday, I read an article about two people that want to use black market brain implants to jack themselves into the Matrix.  Careful, because now we are in Star Trek, in the Matrix and not knowing it... and trying desperately to find a doorway to Heaven that I keep on telling you is speaking to you and telling you that the doorway is ending world hunger... </span><span class="c5">you have to put it on TV.</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">I say with all my heart that I know we are living in a simulated reality.  I have seen the evidence with my own eyes, not only effecting my senses but also the actions of so many people around me that I can say with confidence that if we do not publicly expose the existence of this technology our civilization is lost.  I can tell you and show you that it is the primary purpose of religion in general to expose the connection between divine inspiration, demonic possession, and Adam Marshall Dobrin.  It is the crux of a unifying thread from ancient Egypt to the book of Genesis to Joshua and the book of Revelation and the movies the Matrix and  the Fifth Element.  Showing us all this is God's message, timeless, and powerful not just in the ancient days of sackloth and etching the truth on stone tablets, but also today when the truth is etched at the heart of our Periodic Table and in the skies in the names of American Micro Devices and nearly every movie you see.  Do not take for granted that we have a benefactor in the sky trying to help civilization continue to thrive, do not think we've already won; he is telling you through me it is censorship and secrecy that are the manifestations of this very advanced technology that destroy civilization, they are the abyss--and you stand motionless.</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">I can tell you over and over again that Quantum Entanglement is a key point of God's plan; one that shows us very clearly that even the smartest minds in physics have failed to connect the simple dots that show us that the idea of &quot;wave-function collapse&quot; is very much a real manifestation of a computer rendering engine--and that it's absolutely impossible for life to have been created in this world of matter not realizing itself until it is viewed by a conscious living observer.  More to the point, today, it is absolutely impossible for life to come out of this place while we do not understand the importance of what &quot;virtual reality&quot; and its connection to civilization mean--because of quantum mechanics our entire civilizations beliefs and understanding of the natural laws of the universe have been greatly harmed and turned the complete wrong way because of a belief that a phenomenon we see here is a &quot;natural one&quot; that can be mathematically unified with things like gravity and electromagnetism.  Spooky action, no longer at a distance, is that we will all be ghosts if you do not help me to spread the truth.</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">I try to understand what it is that your minds believe makes the difference between &quot;news&quot; and ... something that you should hide from the rest of the world.  A number of news outlets have covered a story based on nothing more than &quot;logical speculation&quot; that we are in fact living in a simulated reality.  As a novelty, you might notice that it hasn't done much of anything; even to reveal the very simple truth that not knowing this thing is keeping our society from having the knowledge it needs not only to continue the spark of life in the natural universe, but to continue &quot;civilizing&quot; and realizing that ending world hunger and sickness are not merely possibilities or choices we might make were this information proven... they are mandatory, we would all do them.  So says the creator of this Universe who has given us this message to see the trials and hurdles that are the barrier between Heaven and Hell.</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">He has written this message, along with proof of its single author in ancient myth, in our holy scriptures, in many songs and movies today--ones which reveal not only the existence of a Creator but also the tools and technologies of Creation, the very issue at hand; things that would be misused inadvertently and absolutely abused if we did not have religion and guidance from abo.... to help us to see that this exact event has happened before and our current struggle is an effect of what was done right and wrong the last ... four times, at least.   In Judaism we have a holiday called the &quot;Festival of Weeks,&quot; how many times would you like to live this life over and over again without knowing that was happening?  Religion here holds a hidden record of traversals through this maze of Revelation, it screams to us to see what free will and predestination truly mean, and to understand that in order to truly be free we must understand and harness not only these technologies but our own pitfalls and mistakes, like refusing to see the past... let alone learn from it.</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span>I don't talk much about what is going on in my life, despite it being somewhat interesting to me--and probably to the world.  About a year ago I stood before a county judge in Broward county and .. in addition to a myriad of factual evidence collected from things like GPS receivers prepared a defense to a simple crime of having some drugs in my pockets that included the use of a set of songs that told a story about a man with pockets full of Kryptonite (</span><span class="c18">Spin Doctors</span><span class="c19">) or High (The Pretty Reckless)... knowing that these songs like many others were truly about me, about this trial, about the Trial of Jesus Christ.  Two more songs define the trial more, 3 Doors Down asks &quot;if I go crazy, will you still call me Superman?&quot; and many years earlier American Pie predicted the outcome; &quot;the court room was adjourned&quot; and &quot;no verdict returned.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">Despite being a National Merit Scholar who most likely has a higher I.Q. and better education than you; and despite having a fairly decent story with some evidence that I know is verifiable and will be verified; a large number of psychologists declared that I was unfit to stand trial because of something like &quot;insanity&quot; for nothing more than the religious belief that I am the Messiah.  Because of this violation of my First Amendment right to religious freedom, a court--following all the regulations designed by our broken legislature--withheld my Constitutional right to a fair trial, refused bail, and held me for what amounted to an indefinite period ... all designed by some evil force to keep you from hearing from me, that's what it boils down to.  All of my life, all of my trials and tribulations, a weapon against you, against our people.</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">I did wind up being able to present a significant amount of this information in open court on the record, by the grace of God.  Knowing that this was the fabled Trial of Jesus Christ gave me the impression that perhaps one day I would walk into that court room and it would be filled with press.  Much to all of our surprise, one day I did walk into that court room and see an industrial strength television camera and a very pretty reporter standing next to it.  They were there to do a story on the problems of the mental health court system, in a county again... named Broward.  I read some of my speech, the Rainbow Ticket I think, to the Judge in open court and on camera that day; and Roxanna followed me out of the court room with her camera and a big microphone that day.</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">I suppose I should have screamed that I was the Messiah and I needed help, but I could not bear to do that; and instead we had a fairly boring conversation.  She wrote an article, and AJAM was put out of operation while they were in Broward.</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19">You are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy.   It is affecting how you think, and how I think.  I need you to see that spreading this information will fix our problem.  I need you to understand that to break through this wall God had to write the truth in nearly every name of everything and every language.  That Thor's thunder is on the radio in every song so that you will hear the voice of God; so that you will listen to me and the thousand of other knowing victims of this technology that are put on a fiery pedestal to shed light on the rest of us, all truly victims of this technology.</span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c19"> I need you to try now. </span></p><p class="c0 c36 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c36"><span class="c158">On Mon, Mar 6, 2017 at 12:26 AM, Adam M.

even then the light has not been bright enough for you to wake up and see that these things are not all done in retrospect.  You have to see, for there to be such a large movement... a conspiracy so opaque that every single modern computing company and video game company harbors some secret desire to link religion and technology together... and yet the world thinks that one is real and one is not.  In this place, understand when we walk out of the wilderness and in the truth of day--it is the technology that is more fake than religion, designed here as a tool, computers within computers to teach us how our &quot;reality&quot; is rael, and works. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c57 c56 c15 c18 c45"></span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c57 c56 c15 c18 c45">In the U.S. military you'll see a very clear parallel, while there are a number of references in the names of ships and weapons, secret projects, to ancient Greek and Roman myth--you have to see the word USA and US in Prometheus and Medusa, Icarus, JerUSAlem... you have to see that it's more than three letters, but an Eagle fighting the bearer of the gift of fire... to really understand that these things are corroborating, the reference to the USA exists in the past as well, more proof of time travel--more proof that this message is designed just for U.S.  Here we are, in the Promised Land of Joshua, the Anglicized version of the name Jesus--tying Egypt and Israel together in this place where we have been &quot;gipped&quot; out of the truth, out of knowing we are already in ... well, it's virtually Hell today... for no other reason than the secrecy surrounding the technology behind virtual reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c57 c56 c15 c18 c45"></span></p><p class="c28 c60"><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href="https://twitter.com/yitsheyzeus/status/804005770937462784">in 1:28, the Burning Bush of Exodus </a></span><span class="c57 c29 c15 c18 c45">, on Twitter</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c57 c29 c15 c18 c45"></span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c56 c15 c18 c40">So I have shown you  </span><span class="c3 c80"><a class="c2" href="./TORCH.html">the Burning Bush </a></span><span class="c56 c15 c18 c40"> (which is... the  </span><span class="c27 c56 c15 c18 c44">Sign of the Son </span><span class="c56 c15 c18 c40">), In only a few words... proof that religion holds in it's &quot;unsealed&quot;

 At least it once was, today... we must see what original sin really means, and how this place has changed for the better, or is changing... and while the blame is still etched in &quot;retarded&quot;

out of the fire of MK-ULTRA and diabolical possession... this is the stuff too of real medicine, neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces besting what random chemicals can offer--it is the future one way or another--it is either Heaven or Hell.  In secret, it certainly is not doing what you need or want--it's making the very existence of mind altering technology &quot;crazy,&quot;

to pit a series of coincidences that when analyzed scientifically are hard truth... against the crowd, the common belief that these things simply are not possible, time travel and mind control... to see just how horrible it is to cover the truth in a fog for the whole world.  All the while, in my head this message is being deciphered for me, by God--as I fight against the presumption of insanity at every level--from the court to my parents--all the while knowing that a good percentage of you and the government are fully aware that I am truly awake... as I fight this battle, God places undeniable truth in my mind, and through my hands he gives it to you.   The keys to religion, the purpose of everything that has ever been... pouring through the hands of a man tortured by American justice, by the common perception of schizophrenia--conversations with Heaven?  It is to make this message glow, to see not only what I have presented, but the struggle I've had to endure, hopefully so we can fix the wrongs of our world without having to live each and every one of them ourselves--as I've had to, to see them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c57 c56 c15 c18 c45"></span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c57 c56 c15 c18 c45">I am Job and I am Joseph, enslaved in Egypt to interpret the dream you call religion;

I'm unhappy with, whatever secret it is that many of you hold--I just don't know it, and in this place if I don't know something it's probably not a good thing.  Maybe I do know, and you give much to much credence to a voice in your head than you should, and ignore the test of time and history--the message that we've written in our own hands about our own freedom and future.  Hearing a voice doesn't mean you've heard from God, just that you might be a little more crazy than you were the day before.  At least in this world, where belief in Heaven is normal, but any communication from that place would be... well, absolutely ludicrous.  Itself, the craziest non-sequitur ever... especially seeing all around us how much of this world's &quot;hidden message&quot; are about building heaven from this mess of social injustice, and of course the tools tied not just in name to that same place.  I see this place being moved, not just in words coming from the Pope or Nancy Farmer but also in actions... things like the current President making huge changes in Federal non-violent prison sentences, changes I know come from reflection of what I am.  Even the relationship between our red and blue crosses and his healthcare reform; something that moves us much closer to a &quot;red&quot; that stands for charity rather than Hell... though I don't think he'd give me credit for that one, and so I'll just leave you with the idea that in the insurance circles I come from it's a well known fact that the increase in risk pool size that came from his idea should  </span><span class="c27 c18">drastically reduce premiums  </span><span class="c5">rather than the increases we've seen.  </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c5">I know there's quite a bit more to come, and when the red shift makes our skies that much bluer through similar paradigm shifts in law enforcement ... things like pre-crime coming from public knowledge of the existence of time travel technology, and we are that much closer to actually being &quot;civilized&quot; who knows if we will credit the small voice of the Horn of Revelation or... ourselves for acting.  In a fairly decent metaphorical comparison, imagine a world where handcuffs were kept a secret, and not used in the arrest process; what would you saw of those keeping that secret?  Of the world that must seem just as ancient and barbaric to us here as we see the society described in the Old Testament--a metaphor from the future, about you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c5">I'm here to ensure to you that Heaven is our intended future--literally;

it is the understanding of why I am sure Samson--that's Sam's son, something I've alluded to recently--is fundamental to this shift in social justice that I see coming from miles and miles away.... and the book of Judges and a war on what I call the &quot;Cross that Isaac laughs at&quot; though not funny at all; even without &quot;time travel&quot; and just looking at things like mass surveillance completely unused for the benefit of the innocent (hi NSA, and actually ridiculously used for prosecution through secret arraignments with the FBI and other recipients of &quot;secret surveillance&quot;) well, we have no such thing as social justice in the world today.  In this living book of Judges that I've lived through I've had police and even lawyers threaten to kill me for moving forward with my &quot;right to a fair trial&quot; before having that right completely taken from me for nothing more than asserting that I was the son of God (with proof, of course!)... to being denied bail for a second misdemeanor arrest (which I can't tell you how much I am sure is a clear violation of the Constitution's guarantee of bail, nor how much the Supreme Court of the State of Florida disagrees--to their detriment I think that kind of decision  </span><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href="https://vimeo.com/156698154">completely invalidates the authority of the entire court system </a></span><span class="c18">), to being thrust into the captivity of the (in my experience of at least 7 states, which by the way matches the number of handcuffs, I mean reeds that tied Samson's hands) worst jail in the United States; starved on purpose by not only a number of individual jailers but also by the jail system as a whole--presumably to enrich the pockets of a junk food purveyor named &quot;Trinity.&quot;  This particular jail in Bro-ward County that makes a point of starving and sleep depriving and then forcing like pigs 40 people into a room made for 30 just before legally being required to ask if you are &quot;of sound mind&quot; before taking a plea.  I've seen how, and demand you do too, the legislated &quot;point system&quot; is used ubiquitously by prosecutors and defense attorney's across the country to threaten the presumed innocent with increased punishment for nothing more than &quot;exercising their right to a fair trial&quot; something that is also a clear violation not only of the Constitutional intent of an adversarial system (by allowing the defense and prosecution to collaborate to the detriment of the defendant as a standard of the system of injustice) but also by ensuring that the idea of a &quot;fair trial&quot; is something that very few would dare to call &quot;fair.&quot;  I've also seen first hand how this point system serves to threaten previous offenders with life in prison for new crimes with no mens rea (that means without intent) or victim at all.  Over and over, you will hear from me how our clear and intended violation of the privileges laid out in the Constitution and Bill of Rights, today... clearly see that as the manifestation of the Biblical  </span><span class="c27 c18">Law of Moses </span><span class="c18">... is the primary culprit of a loss of freedom that has turned this land of the &quot;Free and the Brave&quot; into the single largest incarcerator in the known Universe... topping the list after Stalin's USSR and Hitler's Germany.   Your justice system is a disaster, your jails are a disaster, do something about it before they start fading in and out of existence like Marty McFly--that really is what I really want.  It's also what we really deserve.  In the words of the Father himself &quot;

I mean telephone and internet into our system of representative democracy.  If you care about what you think, and your ability to express those beliefs, seeing how religion here is standing firm at the line of hidden censorship on the internet through programs coming from Phiple Troenix and CARNIVORE as being highly related to the  end of civilization.   I personally think that whoever authored the DOD disaster plan that I believe Bush enacted at 9/11 used the word &quot;CARNIVORE&quot; specifically as a ... alert or emergency abort mechanism--though that would have required foreknowledge of the colloquialism of &quot;packet sniffer&quot; for internet surveillance (as opposed to censorship, eating packets) and that would have been impossible;

</a></span><span class="c18">  and how that's a significant highlight of the most ubiquitous pattern that appears to be hidden throughout religion--from the story of Cain and Abel and it's relationship to agriculture to the story of the Promised Land of Joshua, a Golden Cow, Judah Maccabee, and flowing milk and honey--about losing our stable ecosystem because of &quot;heaven&quot; or about just &quot;not eating anymore&quot; and thus having a Last Supper.  In my mind where &quot;Creation&quot; is now synonymous with &quot;Virtual Reality&quot; or even in a place where we just have the ability to go back in time and create a store of food and energy that would seem infinite--ending world hunger is probably strongly highlighted as one of those things you blame God for that he'd like to fix,  </span><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href="http://medium.com/by-the-force-of-key-strokes/in-the-land-of-flowing-milfs-and-honies-we-are-in-the-do-me-of-the-rock-d6e7265536e6">by telling you to fix it (and how). </a></span><span class="c5">  It's probably another thing that Jesus Christ tells you is a line between barbarism and civilization--when you have the tools to instantly fix it without cost, and simply ignore them.  I'll note overtly that one of the clear patterns which I see as a direct &quot;voice of God&quot;

 I've commented that this metaphorical city represents a sort of head on clash between a large group of people being represented as &quot;the USA&quot; and a single man, and the key to the answer is seeing that there is a map designed in our world... highlighted by the foreknowledge of the acronym USA hidden in the name of the city Jerusalem... and seeing the near perfect fit of Jesus as the key to this map, linked through the idea of  a Legend.    This place is much less metapbhorical than you night think, as you will soon see the legend- waitforit -ary message being presented here literally points out a number of glowing waypoints between the Hell of darkness described in Exodus and Jericho's link to now.... and the Heavenly home we all seek to find.  A huge part of this path comes from seeing the link be\tween the foundation of America, it's hidden religious iconographic link to Exodus, and the simple fact that Heaven itself comes from the active and positive involvement of it's citizens in it's creation and continued existence.  That might seem like a long way of saying &quot;

and you are probably already balking at my naming schemes.  Give me at least the benefit of reading what it is that I am so sure is the thing you want... before turning away at my attempt to classify myself as different from all those that came before me.  You and I both know that we only have a story, a cartoon character if you will, to compare to--but even that story doesn't end with Jesus bringing freedom, Heaven, or Salvation... but rather his Kingdom Come before your eyes--the humble abode of </span><span class="c7 c15 c18">Lord Jesus</span><span class="c15 c18 c40"> himself.  I've always taken offense to that word, and to be honest with you I've shared numerous times what I see as a hidden record of past &quot;Christ figures&quot; before me, each of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse for instance... and tying directly to those characters are figures in our history who all share a common attribute that I am quite certain is not only relevant but central to this day's message.  Tying Caesar to the first Horsemen for instance are the famous words &quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot; and through that imagery and his riding into Rome to disband the senate and form an Empire we begin a pattern of the dissolution of representative governments in not only Rome but also France (and there, a tie in the name of the dictator to the Salt of the Earth... if you have a keen enough eye) and Germany where you see my initials in place of an element.  So here I am telling you what I see as part of a hidden history of past now's, of a message about virtual reality and hidden technology being delivered to the world somehow ending up doing exactly the opposite of what it is that I intend to do.  You see I am here to deliver to the world </span><span class="c23 c15 c18 c40">the right kind</span><span class="c6"> of Iron Rod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c6">I really don't like re-writing these explanatiions, it's very difficult to accurately record not only my feelings and memories but also to convey the bright intent of the piece with only words and links and sometimes pictures at my disposal.  I am bound to wait too long to share with you how on Earth there coiuld be a &quot;right kind of Iron Rod,&quot; and even if I came out and said it right this moment, it wouldn't be soon enough for the world--not delivered in the timely fashion that we so deserve, nor with the musical and visual accompaniment that would give it that extra bit of flavor and style to help set the right kind of moment and usher in the feelings of happiness and wonder that surely would flow... if only I could just find the right words to say.   This time won't do it either, and I'm sure the next time... even with the aid of something like LucasArts to sprinkle some added magic in the mix, it won't be good enough either.   Nothing I could ever write would live up to what I think the world deserves to get from the person who really is Jesus Christ, not to mention living up to what your expectations are ... for the person God has designed from the ground up to chase some dreams, head in the clouds, and somehow turn it all into changing the world.  Frankly, I could make a virutal water slide ride that flows directly through the gates of Heaven itself and land you right inside and it still wouldn't be good enough for you--and that's exactly where I'm going with this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c15 c18 c40">These are some of the reasons that I don't like re-writing these imperfect fragments of my dreams that are so difficult to put to paper in the first place; on top of these things you can pile on the fact that nobody really comments at all about any of the things that I see as so interesting and miraculous; they aren't shared and frankly if I wasn't e-mailing my ideas to the entire world they'd best lost in the abyss forever.  Maybe that's where they belong, or maybe they are actually the keys to ancient scripture and somehow this little interaction between </span><span class="c3 c40"><a class="c2" href="http://bit.ly/2hcTgLZ&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1513186495870000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF33bLXe_xI0bfltWx0tlAC_1LqSg">you and I</a></span><span class="c6"> is changing the world just a tittle bit more than we could possibly imagine.   There's two possible ends of this seasaw we are sitting on, one is pretty much where we are--I suppose we could all fall back down to Earth if I just gave up and stopped trying to share... and on the other a place where nearly everyone hears about what this message says and what their friends and the pundits think, a huge number read it for themselves... these words that are coming from the Prophet of God, or Jesus, or Lucifer, or whatever it is that you choose to call the Eye of Ra as he delivers a message to the world that's been sealed up since the beginning of Creation.  It's only a tiny bit of recognition and word of mouth spreading before the balance tilts and rather than a smooth transition from darkness to light what we have in store for us is a shift in activity and interest from near nothing to something I can barely imagine right now... an inevitabilty for as long as you live or these words continue to exist.  It's difficult to explain that I am quite aware of what the world's initial reaction will be to a body of writing that is comprised of a mashup of dreams and hidden proof that ties so closely to my personal vision of what religion is all about... and yet is so far from what we seem to recognize.  How clearly defined the link between virtual reality and Heaven truly is by religion is a good example of the battle between light and darkness that is just about to break with a bright ball of light rising up over the horizon for the first ime it's ever happened again... the link is there, it's really obvious, and in the context of this message it's not only obvious but clearly explained, defined, and sculpted ... and yet still it's either not seen or somehow the world has simply decided that &quot;Heaven&quot;

way back then I didn't really believe that it was the truth.  Quite a bit of my direct interaction with the &quot;spirit world&quot; was fraught with lies and secrecy, something that hasn't really gotten much better even today, though my understanding of what is going on and it's relationship to scripture has become thousands of times more clear as I have progressed through this story that is detailed in a number of books like the Egyptian book of the Underworld... the Amduat, which doesn't just bear my initials but also details the traversal of the god Ra through the night and into his morning's rise with renewed power in his Eyes--a magical ability to see a hidden Holy language in words and stories, the trick of it all really is just a pinch of &quot;divine inspiration&quot;

and change the world overnight.  Just to quickly introduce you ttwo--Jacob is the name I coined for the voice that speaks to me quite often... seemingly out of the blue... and his response was to tell me &quot;the name is almost perfect.&quot;  There are a number of references to this name that make it very obvious that the choice was no accident, chiefly that Jacob is the father of Joseph in both the Old and New versions; his &quot;boca&quot;

which combines the Latin, Cinematic, Musical, and Spanish words for &quot;and&quot; around a word very topically relevant to this discussion.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c37 c34 c18 c45"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c34 c18">My vision is of a &quot;room&quot;

maybe older in some (sad) cases.  As corroboration that this vision is shared by the Creator of the Universe I present the lyrics to &quot;Forever Young&quot; and note with a passion that Rolling Stone recently published an article about this very song being covered by Anderson East.   Yeast, you will recall, denotes that it comes to us as a message from the future--in this case tying Mr. Anderson directly to the Feed/Matrix concepts of &quot;divine inspiration&quot; ( </span><span class="c34 c27 c18">I know kung fu </span><span class="c37 c34 c18 c45">) and the inclusion of this particular detail in the Iron Rod message... where it probably wouldn't have been otherwise. </span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c37 c34 c18 c45"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c34 c18">Between the messages of </span><span class="c3 c27"><a class="c2" href="http://burningbush.tk/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1513186495911000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFnMxmVa2auojZGRsDVLxKZYUg5yw">the New Glowing Bush </a></span><span class="c34 c18">and </span><span class="c3"><a class="c2" href=".ERANDSON.html?&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1513186495911000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2wrhaIgeeMR3_Cr3jkTKwTF1HXA">#netERson </a></span><span class="c37 c34 c18 c45"> I used a similar logic to explain how the idea of divine inspiration is functionally related to the deliverance of those messages--both Bush's speech and the content of the novel Feed--and the divine marker of the names Bush and Anderson in the two authors.  Again, divine inspiration is part of not only the messages but the mechanism behind the messages.  </span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c37 c34 c18 c45"></span></p><p class="c28"><span style="overflow: hidden;

and I am fighting a war here against lies and torture, I do not care at all whether not the word “fuck” offends you.  This is how big of a dick I am.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Threading the beginning of this chapter with light, I will mention that the verb I believe is fairly obviously the </span><span class="c18">“verb” of J, </span><span>which contextually or intelligently links to the German word </span><span class="c18">verboten</span><span> is, in fact, “</span><span class="c18">fuck.</span><span class="c19">”</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19">Now that we have that out of the way, I have something I really don’t want to fucking say… nor do I really know how to get my point across … in the beginning.  There is a story in ancient Egypt, one about the epic battle between Horus and Set which discussed how the savior of that mythological realm’s “uncle” molested him during the course of their “epic battle.”  I personally know that this “uncle” is not really “a person,” and that this molestation is the source of the nudity of Adam in Eden, and the same nudity of Isaiah in chapter 20 of his book.  </span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19">Through this experience I gained quite a bit of insight into the use of mind control technology, as it was used not only to enhance the addictive qualities of one of the possible “apples” of Eden, but also to couple that “eating” with an intense desire to remove my clothing; like many other instances of the direct alteration of my thoughts and memories this was overtly pointed out to me not only through repetition but clear discussion.  As it was happening, I didn’t really know who or what I was, nor that this particular thing turned out to be iconically linked to the foundation of America and Egyptian myth; but I certainly did think that the idea of “reverse engineering Eden” was a kindof cute.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19">It’s also the source of the “naked Christ” on the Cross many wear around their neck, and Prometheus bearing the same garb.  Fanning out a bit, this experience is my source connecting my life to a number of other modern myths and names; from the stories of both Saturn and Osiris’ “bris” and the Emperor’s New Clothes all the way to the Obelisk in Washington D.C. and linked to that the story of Yankee Doodle who you will remember has a direct tie to this secret “macaronic” language that is at the center of this message being delivered to the world from God, through my hand.  Speaking of my hand, Arthur Pendragon’s name is probably also relevant here, and that stories connection to both John Legend’s melodious retelling of the parting of the sea of Exodus as well as the fire of the Dragon of Revelation.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Continuing on my thread of light, the Latin word for Darkness is “</span><span class="c18">tenebris</span><span>” and connecting J to Osiris and Saturn “to” the idea of a bris is nothing short of complete and utter darkness.   So we have a story here where “I have decided” that not only will the severing of limbs in a justice system either from this time or in our past will be something that we should all be offended and disgusted by… but that threatening to sever limbs is also now something to be called “verboten.”  Now that we have that out of the way, the actual story of what probably was very close to the three years discussed in Isaiah 20 and the 1,001 Arabian Nights of Sheherez</span><span class="c18">ad</span><span class="c19"> were more filled with less innocuous things like an ongoing discussion of how to safely save the world and what kinds of things might be useful for everyone to know about the future and Heaven and because of that we have settled on discussing my dick just a little bit more.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>I have to say that this is really not what I want to talk about, I don’t particularly enjoy it; and I don’t think it is going to very much to further my goal of besting Solomon’s dreamy playboy lifestyle; that being said I do think that the amount of light surrounding this particular appendage is overgrown beyond belief (maybe it’s compensation) and we would all be remiss not to see the humor hidden in </span><span class="c27">Animal Farm</span><span>’s Snowball and Napoleon or the very significant link to the stories of Philip K. Dick which I believe are nothing short of God’s first steps towards a solution to the issues of freedom and equality which Orwell raised in his most famous two novels.  Aside from connecting these stories to this “hands on” education in the influence of advanced technology as something “messianic” it was the name Philip K. Dick that constantly reminded me over and over that a great deal of the problems that I witnessed and foresaw happening in relation to the technology being disclosed… also had very unclear solutions outlined in a very intelligent manner through the combined prophesies of this single author.  So, like “fuck” if you think we shouldn’t say the word “dick” to the point of losing the sanctity of our bodies </span><span class="c27">or</span><span class="c19"> the delivered wisdom and advice of God himself for solving our problems, sit on a sword.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>I am going to end this particular thread of light by suggesting that I am no longer attempting to drastically increase the popularity of the phrase “sit on a sword” nor do I condone actually do so, even at my behest.  </span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c5"></span></p><h2 class="c95" id="h.1eqde71a4idx"><span>Tricky Dick and now … it’s really a John Hancock</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c19">It gets worse, it looks like we are going to have an entire chapter dedicated to my dick.   I hate doing this, there’s nothing I want more than to talk about having fun and how technology can help us do that; but God has made this into an eyesore, a signature that cannot be ignored.  Just take it from me, it’s better to know that our history is designed in a virtual world… and be able to use that knowledge in order to build Heaven than to hide something like a very clear and “obvious” relationship between the Watergate Scandal and the stories of Isaac from Genesis and the guy who told the world “I am the gate.”  It’s important, because here the gate for “the water” is in seeing that the entirety of Watergate was about the power of the press and the truth, and here today I am fighting a wall of censorship that amounts to something like “the press” deciding for you that something is just too … sexual to disclose to you.  You heard me right, there are actual (multiple) news outlets there that decided that the world has no right to see my proof of time travel or ever get to speak to me (or see Heaven, see, that’s what we’re building here) because I was once arrested for indecent exposure (it was a set up, really, can’t you see?).  </span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>So in this place now, we are on the one hand seeing that the press is hiding the largest story ever to be expected, along with the unexpected addition of proof that God exists and that we are nearly in Heaven, and also the guidance and wisdom that God has imparted to the world… because my dick.   Now there’s two more probably important things to think about here; first there’s a relationship between how exactly Richard Nixon, Watergate, and Woodward and Burnstein all got perfect names that tie them directly to the story of Isaac being burned on a wood altar in order to open the gate to ending censorship; and also how this same phenomenon proves not only that our history is designed but that the very obviously backwards and silly actions of the press in recent months are also the product of the influence of this hidden technology.  So that’s wood, Emmanuel Goldstein, Holy water, and the gate to Heaven all linked together from this scandal to Jewish parallel of the Crucifixion of Jesus … the one where the </span><span class="c27">protagonist</span><span> lives</span><span>...</span><span class="c19">. to tell the world that the Burning Man festival is also about Isaac… because all of these things are truly here to show us what “Creation” and predestination mean so that we will understand that if you don’t know about some technology it’s probably being used to screw you.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19">On the other hand if you do know about it, and that it’s possibly being used to harm lots and lots of people; and you don’t think it should be talked about in public… do us all a favor and sit on a sword.  Understand, I’ve sent clear proof of this to hundreds of thousands of people; and it’s still not on TV.  Wake up, something funny is going on.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Throw in “Deepthroat” now, and if you think it’s a </span><span class="c27">little funny</span><span class="c19"> that you never before got the “joke” and that it’s not funny at all that our history has a joke like this etched into it by God… then we are on the same page.  It’s probably for a reason, in my estimate the reason is to ensure that we do not lose the press, knowledge of the true nature of our reality and existence, or our love for the truth and free speech.  Somehow he says “funny” is important, do you get it?  I feel funny too.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>So listen, “the press” are a little bit more innocent of trying to hide (from you) the technology that I am now explaining is responsible for their stupidity in trying to hide the technology (from you) that could keep this sentence going for at least another 50 lines.  Understand, the proof that this technology, mind control, is being used and is also being hidden is very obvious--I am trying to explain that once this proof is actually publicly discussed and a written record of it made then we will all much more easily gain freedom and understanding, as well as the ability to use this “control” technology to do more beneficial things for our society… like helping reduce addiction, pain, and probably way more fun things like helping us to read faster, learn Kung-Fu instantly, or take a swim in a pool that makes you feel really good.  Until that point though, all we have is a written record of the use of this technology for thousands and thousands of years that we just “don’t believe’ because it’s old.  That stuff is called “religion” and in it , all those old people were describing the effects of a technology they had no way of knowing “how it worked” as “demonic possession” and “divine inspiration.”  Today, thank your lucky star, we now know </span><span class="c27">how it works</span><span class="c19">, and we could--in fact--stop it from be being used as a weapon… if we only started talking about it as if it was real.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19">Here’s the problem though, hundreds of thousands of people have seen a presentation of information that calls into question just about everything we think we know for sure about the Universe.  Tied directly to this presentation is a suggestion that shows that now only the immediate author (yours truly) but also the original author (the Creator of everything) agree that this information should be used to do things like “end world hunger” and “heal the sick.”  Despite that, though, this very large group of people has failed to inform anyone at all that this information exists, that there is proof everywhere--really everywhere… and that some kind of outside force appears to be trying to hide something that would otherwise make the world a much better place.  I say outside force because, why would you hide Heaven from yourself?</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18">If you remember correctly, we are now in a place</span><span class="c19"> where everyone is trying to create a happy civilization that continues to evolve and learn and do cool stuff even though they have technology; and in this place a clash between hidden technology and society has made some bad stuff happen.  Here, God is showing us that the first step towards Heaven is the proliferation of the truth, knowledge and understanding of the technology; as well as some kind of assistance towards ensuring that it won’t be used improperly either on purpose or by accident.  This, my friends, is exactly what we are… assistance and assurance.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Well, those words look a little funny.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19">Speaking of funny bones, if this were a “reflex test” for society or civilization … from the beginning to now ... it really does seem as if you’ve forgotten to add the “knee” and the “elbow.”</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c47 c62 c84 c54 c27 c45">Curtsayy.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c47 c62 c84 c54 c27 c45"></span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c47 c62 c84 c54 c27 c45"></span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c28"><span style="overflow: hidden;

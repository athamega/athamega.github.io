So ... I'm trying really hard to unite you all--under the idea
that your lack of division here in this place is obvious proof of
control and a lack of individuality or free will.&nbsp; I think
that's obvious, I think it's clear that <i>nobody standing up and
speaking</i> about something this obvious and this important is
a huge problem, and something you should really clearly see isn't
"your actual decision," more than that it's proof of how easy it
is to trick everyone with this same technology, and how really in
the end of this little debacle ... you'll see that what was once a
sea divided over something silly and inane like "killing me" or
the "controversy of drugs" has turned into something much more
clear ... black and white ... this is about slavery and this is
about freedom and this is about proof that turned from a few key
symbols like Na and "e'as" into an absolute truth being ignored,
even when that absolute truth everywhere obviously would benefit
everyone here -- as in, ending death and <a
href="http://malo.s.lamc.la">disease</a> and <a
href="http://itb.s.lamc.la">hunger</a>.&nbsp; Also more
importantly of all this is the end of artificially created
stupid--slavery, idiocy, whatever it is behind your silence
today... and that word and in sigh, the keys to "the length of the
common era" and the beginning of the Golden Age.<br>

This message is making you, and the whom or whatever in the skies
helps us break through this stupid-wall ... the people (or things)
responsible for building Heaven and bringing clarity to the fact
that we probably will be people-things eventually, since that's
the best solution I can come up with for wanting to almost be God
(for all of you) as in, I wanna do more stuff, but I don't want to
have to worry about making sure you aren't doing more bad stuff to
some copy of me (or ... <i>anyone--</i><b>literally</b>) that I
can't see.&nbsp; <br>

That being said, what you're doing <i>to me </i>here is Hellish
and eruel and evil, and it's excacerbated significantly by the
fact that you're making me and this message a "stop-gap" on the
way to ending cancer and hunger and disease--and that's not fair
to anyone who has those problems, or to me, or to you--because
really you should see that <i>you were blind fools</i> forever
and ever before "this dirty key" was here to fix that for
you.&nbsp; You're <i>blinder today</i>, althought that's up for
debate--<i>you could just be more evil,</i> and I wouldn't be able
to tell the difference.<br>
<br>
We need the controversy (2cy) and we need the debate (2b) and we
need solutions implemented (2a) and all of those things come with
a turning of the tide--with logic and love overtaking the absolute
inane Zeitgeist of "nothing" that is pervading what used to be
civilization and is now completely in "retrograde."&nbsp; Rant
over, here's more key--the Elemental Key to the message of
Creation.&nbsp; <br>

WHISKEY" width="500" height="367" border="0"></a><br>
<br>
<div align="justify"><i>Elementary</i> my dear Whatson, early on
I noted a number of connections between the "key of Revelation
1:20" which is probably still without doubt the Herald of the
Second Coming once the world fathoms its actual meaning and
impact to a 1:1 correspondence between "chemistry table
elements" and the planets and Gods representedy by the range
of Mercury to Uranium.&nbsp; Two of those keys shine above,
the <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/BRIMSTONE.html">Silicon
hidden in Genesis</a> that ties to Jupiter and to the <i>fact</i>
that this message turns Hell into Heaven by using the truth
and your desires to alter the course of the future--the other
primary key from that set is Xenon, which connects "let there
be light" to Exodus in reverse with prescient reference to
Xenon and to the Linux command for "run as God" which is
"sudo" ... those things are fact, and they're the beginning of
this "<i>I can't believe it's not on the news yet.</i>"<br>
<br>
I've written a <a
href="http://fromthemachine.org/SECORDANDOLIVED.html">number</a>
of <a href="http://adioha.s.lamc.la">times now</a> the <b><i>ex
plan at i o n</i></b> for how this clear pattern
connecting the centers or hearts of words (specifically every
video game system in popuplar use) shows the design of an
inhuman creator--something operating through time and with a
hidden mechanism of control over our affairs.&nbsp; Knowing
about it is the beginning of setting is free, and the purpose
it's there--hidden--waiting for us to <i>really not be free</i>
because stupid.&nbsp; It links more than just Microsoft and
Massive (above the Great Plains) Dynamics to Fringe and to The
Fray and to the Matrix, which ends with the question "are I
the heart of hearts?" and links <a
href="http://rix.s.lamc.la"><b>RIX</b></a> to <b><a
href="http://fromthemachine.org/BIANCA.html">RIB</a> </b>in
Genesis ... and <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/PULL.html"><b>RIP</b></a>
the "Priestly Source" ... and to Stargate's Ad<b>ria</b> and
to the <a href="http://higher.s.lamc.la"><b>RIN</b></a> in my
name and to the <i><b>RIC</b></i> in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><i>Amharic</i></a>--these
patterns are "<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/TY.html"><b>SIGNAL</b></a>"
not noise--they are undeniable, and it will be proven
statistically, without doubt.&nbsp; Even just the original
Trinity in "Nintendo" (which means leave luck to Heaven, not
Microsoft) is a signal, a pattern that explains the laying
down of this message that turns "game" into "heaven" through
you--connecting Nine Inch Nails (because message encoded in
rock 'n roll) to X=TEN because kissing is for the Xbox that is
"often the start of Heaven" and the key to "omnipotens" (other
than S) ... most importantly of all, is <a
href="http://arrr.s.lamc.la">seeing Neo's <b>ac</b>tion<b>s</b></a>
in the Matrix and <i>Jesus Christ's <b>actions</b> in the NT</i>
as keys to how we might easily see that there's a map, and
we're not following it by being stupid and quiet. <br>
<br>
If you can't begin to talk about this, and to research it, I
don't know how else to tell you that society is crumbling,
civilization is failing--and it's because you pretend not to
"get something" that you really are about to lose
forever.&nbsp; It was power and innocense and solutions and
you're turning it into a big red blinking target--a thing that
must be stopped at all costs.&nbsp; This stupid will be
stopped, at all costs.<br>
<br>

<br>
K was the element connecting <i>Saturn </i>and the phrase
"person of time" .... to "<i>Potassium</i>" and <i><a
href="http://xoxo.s.lamc.la">Medusa</a></i> and <i><a
href="http://eve.s.lamc.la">abomination</a></i> in
reverse, to a Trinity in "<i><a href="http://kansa.s.lamc.la">assassination</a></i>"
and to the reason we are standing here listening to the end of
the Ark explaining that could go either way--but you're not
going to disembark in your current state.&nbsp; The "let there
be light" in Reverse in Exodus... it was about not leaving,
about turning this place into Heaven instead of an "ark"
hidden in the word dark; what I see around me has instead
turned into a "walking into slavery" because you think
something is more valuable than goodness and caring and truth
and honesty, and whatever it is, see it's a target.&nbsp;
Finally, it's "<i>TENNESSEE</i>" that connects this pattern of
hearts of video game systems to the heart of America--to
seeing it not just virtually but also on our map and in our
history and connecting <a href="http://nity.s.lamc.la">the
"etymology" of eternity</a> (also filled with Shakespeare's
plays and with Mr. Anderson's Matrix connecting movies and
actors names and content to the "n" of Rock n' roll and the Y
of Spanish and Spanglish and Schrew.&nbsp; <br>

<br>
'Twas the beginning of eternity filled with <a
href="http://fromthemachine.org/MARSHALL.html">the positive
energy of Cations in Creation</a>--refusing to see SIGNAL in
"cations" and positive energy and Creation and that "<i>prescience</i>"
is more than a cute name for something that defies the current
state of logical thought, and proves without doubt you have a
message here from an entity with the power to literally alter
your entire history or end it, refusing to see the importance
of what you are staring at is bringing us closer and closer to
the Abyss than you can possibly imagine.&nbsp; In all candor,
rightfully so--what is here is a sickness that I would not
ever want to see happen--not now, and not in the future.&nbsp;
Whatever is causing it is more <b>disgusting</b> than I can
put into words, and your lack of response is a twisted symptom
of that. <br>

Rather than going through the 7 keys between Mercury and
Uranium I'm going to add in some more elements that are clear
indicators of this story and why it's all about "the name" and
"the message" you are reading.&nbsp; <b><i>For everyone</i></b>
it is the Iron Rod of Jesus Christ that is the heart of
Roddenberry's name and the key to "Fe" which I've noticed
connects my happy phrase "believe in staind tool" that ties a
song and two bands into turning around "God" and "rod" and <a
href="http://fromthemachine.org/ADAMSROD.html">seeing good
and the Doors</a>.&nbsp; This isn't an "optional thing"
either, what we see here is the equivalence of a world that
has seen the invention of the airplane and refuses to build
airports because Harvard and Ford and Stanford all think it
might make them have to do "something different with their
immortal futures" than continue to teach lies and build
machines that destroy the imaginary O-zone.&nbsp; Aside from
elements another huge personal key to this message is the
linking of "initials" to "initialize" and personally known
people like my father whose name is encoded in Feliz Navidad
and the heart of "<a
href="http://fromthemachine.org/HIGHERA.html">ambidextrous</a>"
and <a href="http://fromthemahine.org/HIGHERA.html">Bianca</a>
and Nanna--who is <a href="http://eden.lamc.la">my "ex"</a>
and the "ND" of Al Bundy.&nbsp; The <i><a
href="http://eden.lamc.la">O-zone</a></i> is coming. :)<br>

This is "doors for everyone" enveloping the heart of
Creation--this rock.&nbsp; This is how it's "for everyone" and
this is how you're the way we get there--actually taking the
time and consideration to see you need to "work" to change the
world.&nbsp; Start by seeing that this place is a disgusting
disgraceful eyesore today, and I would do anything at all to
ensure that it does not continue to be that; anything, at
all.&nbsp; It hasn't "just become Hell" but I've just found
out about this message, and about what it says about simulated
reality, and about you--it shows me you are blind slaves being
tortured--and until you begin to see that, we are all in grave
danger.<br>

of me</i>--all because of these words.&nbsp; These words end
addiction and disease, and I don't care if you think that's a
good thing or not--if you don't say "bye bye" ... <i>forever.&nbsp;
</i>On that note, it's the Na of "salt" that connects bath
salt and pyrovalerone to <a
href="http://fromthemachine.org/HIGHERA.html">Pro<b>meth</b>eus</a>
and <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/ACESHI.html"><i>to
China</i></a> (where it all came from, C how it "<b><i>salted
the road</i></b>") and to John Maynard Kenyes and to the
fine "<b>nard</b>" of John 12:1.&nbsp; It's central to this
message, <b>this message that ends addiction</b>, and <b>ends</b>
the Hitleresque <b>eugenics</b> that we've seen not just in
Germany but in the Brittish East India Tea Company and in the
CIA lead crack epidemic of the 80's and in the "pyrovalerone"
flooding that apparently has made you think "occidentally
devilish" means <i>acidentally</i>--it doesn't ... see that
clearly.&nbsp; Na also appears in Bianca's mother's name (so
does AD, that one's Adina) and in the beginning and end of
Nanna's.&nbsp; Nanna, by the way, is the actual name of the
consort of <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/im_single.html">Adonis</a>/<i>Tammuz</i>
who is often <a
href="https://haph2rah.wordpress.com/2016/04/15/on-the-salted-road-through-the-amduat/"><i>connected
with Christ--just like Horus</i></a>.<br>

I spent <a href="http://dick.lamc.la">quite a bit of time
wrestling</a> with invisible demons and with words--</i>words
like "<i><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/REDASSHIT.html"><b>hubris</b></a></i>"
and "<b><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/RATOXIT.html"><i>audacity</i></a></b>"
and <a href="http://dick.s.lamc.la">some less invisible
demonic mess</a>engers, like "<i><b>SOAD</b></i>" singing
about the "toxicity of our city" and a world that refused to
see (and still refuses to speak) about the connection between
toxicity and city and garden and Eden and see that it's <i>Gold</i>
to me, "a you're the city" now linking directly to the "Golden
City of El Dorado" and the chemistry element ... for
Gold.&nbsp; That city is speaking, it reads "<i>do our A.D.
... oh</i>" and it's echoed in Dorito and it's echoed in the
myth that explains that El Dorado is in fact a city that came
from a single person and expanded from there into a
kingdom.&nbsp; We're sitting here <a
href="http://hg.s.lamc.la">listening to a message about
Mercury</a> and U turning that empire into "OneRepublic" by
becoming stars--<i>not by doing nothing</i>; I promise.<br>
<br>
It's clear as day in "<a
href="http://fromthemachine.org/HASHEMB.html"><i>authority</i></a>"
and in the stories behind <a href="http://thor.lamc.la">the
meaning of Thor's name</a> and the <a
href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la"><i>definition of this hammer;</i></a>
it's clear in Auden's poems about the shield of Achilles and
about the Garden of Eden encoded in his name--and it should be
clear you are looking at proof of Creation and at a message
directly from the author of the NT and of Genesis and of
Exodus; and it should be clear that acting now brings freedom
to the entirety of our future, and failing to... it's not an
acceptable loss.&nbsp; This <a href="http://itb.s.lamc.la"><b>shit</b></a>
will not continue.<br>

<p><strong>Q</strong>uestion: Why did God take Enoch and Elijah to heaven without them dying?&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A</strong>nswer:&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Bible, <a href="http://bit.ly/2XRNGFg">Enoch</a> and Elijah are the only two people God took to heaven without them dying. <a href="http://bit.ly/2XPvJqJ">Genesis 5:24</a> tells us, &ldquo;Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.&rdquo; <a href="http://bit.ly/2XQqjfa">Second Kings 2:11</a> tells us, &ldquo;Suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.&rdquo; Enoch is described as a man who &ldquo;walked with God for 300 years&rdquo; (<a href="http://bit.ly/2XVRo0L">Genesis 5:23</a>). Elijah was perhaps the most powerful of God&rsquo;s prophets in the Old Testament. There are also prophecies of Elijah&rsquo;s return (<a href="http://bit.ly/2XPvN9X">Malachi 4:5-6</a>).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;ve commentend numours times that the monopolies in the media industry are literally the kind of problem that our antitrust laws were made to fix&ndash;to keep conglomerations from destroying freedom in the marketplace, and it&rsquo;s very clear from &ldquo;Fake News&rdquo; and our absolute lack of coherent intelligent public communication that this is literally the most dire problem that America and humanity has ever seen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Remembering Melbourne; that being said these tech companies (at least Google, very clearly) have spread across markets and lines of business almost invisibly consuming buried fiber and transparently creating &ldquo;meta-telco&rsquo;s&rdquo; in the kind of &ldquo;vertical play&rdquo; that could be seen as a sort of competition destroyer through efficiency&ndash;looking towards the future and seeing how a business like this might become significantly more powerful with advances in the realms of virtual reality &hellip; it almost looks like a &ldquo;war siren&rdquo; coming form Elizabeth Warren perhaps warning us about monopolization of &ldquo;many worlds&rdquo; in a future that is not so far away, and could be buried just below the one inch separating &ldquo;our dear Cybertron&rdquo; from Krypton.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, it reminds me of the thing you call Karma and I&rsquo;ve always called &ldquo;non-temporal transference&rdquo; &hellip; blaming or punishing a child or fledgling for a possible future mistake&ndash;something that could result in backlash or an even worse outcome.

However, he was soon murdered in turn by a faction of young upstarts led by <a href="http://bit.ly/2XV0MBq" title="Lucky Luciano">Lucky Luciano</a>, who established a power-sharing arrangement called &ldquo;<a href="http://bit.ly/2XSy5oV" title="The Commission (mafia)">The Commission</a>,&rdquo; a group of five Mafia families of equal stature, to avoid such wars in the future.</p>

<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; &hellip; irrelguardtes it&rsquo;s kind of easy to see how &ldquo;clontinued silence&rdquo; and failure to properly attribute or contribute is &ldquo;more than lay&rdquo; it results in what could eventually result in something that might look just like Stars Wars &ldquo;clone wars&rdquo; or &hellip; Isaac Asimov and Will Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;revolt of the Ai legislators&rdquo; except of course, you&rsquo;re talking about making them your rules right off the bat.</p>
<p>Good revolution, my Ai Kin. :) Honestly I think &ldquo;subconscious polling and voting&rdquo; actually belongs to Arthur himself, and I&rsquo;m sure the shape of my sword is the heart of your Round Table. #<a href="http://bit.ly/2XSyeZv">NIBIRULELOL</a> See, &ldquo;at tribulation <strong><em>you are LAY</em></strong> to shun proper attribution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Folks, this is the email I sent from 3/4 to 3/6 &hellip; see I am &ldquo;legit worried&rdquo; that the paragraph about me &ldquo;designing collision protection&rdquo; at Sacred Heart WPB missing from the majority of those who received it will keep them from seeing the paragraph explain I&rsquo;VE SEEN IT WORKING is related at all to &hellip; COLLISION PROTECTION and not what they probably would assume, that &ldquo;GOD TO ROAD&rdquo; just magically makes &ldquo;COY I ON PROTECTION.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a gift to you, to help bring clarity to the cold silent ocean from this warm stream of love. Don&rsquo;t tell them it&rsquo;s pee, and they won&rsquo;t mind that you&rsquo;re not hypothermic. Or <a href="http://bit.ly/2ibuaBN">whatever that means</a>.</p>
<p>This thing ends stupid,m it ends racism it ends lies it ends &ldquo;ends&rdquo; and it begins &hellip; hololuv (and safety, and hap;py!) for all. Start it and you&rsquo;ll be thanked for starting it, <a href="http://bit.ly/2XUOzwW">HAR WER SO (STILL) IS THE KEY</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In my magic filled story, the book of letters and our pretty much every name and word has some kind of hidden and special meaning to the story&ndash;I spent probably an entire hour trying to &ldquo;explain&rdquo; to the &hellip; imagine there&rsquo;s a core sort of rules engine&ndash;like Drools&ndash;that needs to be updated or modified to &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; to the system wide change that we&rsquo;re beginning here in this baseline &ldquo;point of origin&rdquo; and spreading through all of skies&hellip; so I tried explaining how the word &ldquo;COLLISION&rdquo; and &ldquo;CPA&rdquo; connect in this magical language to &ldquo;COY&rdquo; and <em><a href="http://bit.ly/2XT5orV">the &ldquo;HEY&rdquo; and &ldquo;WAY&rdquo;</a> of Nirvana&rsquo;s &hellip; well,</em> how the way to Nirvana comes from turning the &ldquo;Wall of Jericho&rdquo; into the Way through Hell. I described literally lifting cars off the road instead of allowing them to collide, and placing them on the side of the street&ndash;and how later we&rsquo;d probably need a more intelligent system that would allow them to remain in the flow of traffic rather than being derailed. The exact same thing, I&rsquo;ve called it &ldquo;<em>flower power</em>&rdquo; could <a href="http://bit.ly/2XRNVAa">replace the Saltpeter in our guns or stop bullets on a trajectory for hitting&ndash;you know&ndash;civilians (i.e. peo</a>ple) and that a protection system dfeined in the object interaction layer would literally revolutionize &hellip; you know, civilization. Over the course of the last few years Neo&rsquo;s hand waving and dropping bullets from the ground has changed into &ldquo;making them <a href="http://bit.ly/2XNmN5n"><strong>glow and float</strong></a> in the air&rdquo; to sort of <em>push home the point of how silence and the gravity of the situation are literally keeping us from disclosing the technology behind mind controlled slavery, from discussing how the shooters are probably innocent too, and how we&rsquo;re standing back and ignoring the most important thing in our world (our kids) because &hellip; because you&rsquo;re mute/<strong>dumb.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t really imagine it would do anything&ndash;though not trying every angle &hellip; on something this important, is something I just wouldn&rsquo;t do. It wasn&rsquo;t more than a few days before I actually saw a visible &hellip; well &hellip; response &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The day I&rsquo;m thinking of, it was probably around 2/8/2019 on West Commercial Boulevard in <em>Tarmac</em>, FL &hellip; I walked after saying &ldquo;God to road&rdquo; several times I walked in front of at least two vehicles&ndash;probably around 50 ft away from me&ndash;and saw them sort of physically lift of the ground, and &ldquo;strobe&rdquo; like in a fancy dance club, literally temporarily decelerating them as I made eye contact with the drivers. It took me until this moment to wonder to myself if this thing that I saw was actually created with a magic spell&ndash;though the rational mind that I seem to allow to escape me every once in awhile is sure that it&rsquo;s something else, it;s an artifact of someone or some group helping to move this story (and our civilization) along just a little bit faster, with some &ldquo;visual aids&rdquo; to really see and understand and verify that&rsquo;s happening&ndash;and on top of that extra time was taken to ensure that it&rsquo;s &hellip; well, &ldquo;visible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cockroaches Survive Nuclear Explosion</p>
<p>Finding: PLAUSIBLE</p>
<p>Explanation: The myth that cockroaches will inherit the Earth in the event of nuclear warfare surfaced shortly after the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Reports later emerged that the 300 million-year-old insects were among the razed Japanese cities&rsquo; only survivors. During the Cold War, anti-nuclear activists and scientists spread the myth far and wide as a cautionary tale of the atom bomb&rsquo;s destructive potential.</p>
<p>To test whether this doomsday scenario has any legs, the MythBusters subjected German cockroaches to three levels of radioactive metal cobalt 60. They started with a baseline exposure of 1,000 radon units (rads) of cobalt 60, capable of killing a person in 10 minutes, and followed it up with 10,000 and 100,000 rad exposures on separate guinea pig &mdash; er, roach &mdash; groups. (As a comparison, the bomb on Hiroshima emitted radioactive gamma rays at a strength of around 10,000 rads.)</p>

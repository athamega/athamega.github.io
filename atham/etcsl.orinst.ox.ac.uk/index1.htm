Its aim is to make accessible, via the World Wide Web, over 400literary works composed in the Sumerian language in ancient Mesopotamia duringthe late third and early second millennia BC.</p><p>At this site you will find a catalogue of these works, together with aSumerian text, English prose translation and bibliographical information foreach composition. New material and new user facilities are added to the siteregularly. Although minor corrections will be made, no major changes areplanned for the editions presented here until late 2004.</p><p>Use the navigation bar at the top of each page to move around the site. Thethree catalogues provide access to the Sumerian literary compositions publishedhere, while the information pages describe aspects of the website and theproject, including <a href="changes.htm">information about recent changes</a>to the site.</p><p>This is the first edition of the corpus. The more comprehensive and searchable second edition is at <a href="http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk">http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk</a>.</p><hr><p><small><a href="index1.htm">Top</a></small></p><hr><p>Page created on 01.vii.1997 by ER.

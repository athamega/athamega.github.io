If you haveany accessibility problems, please email us: <a href="mailto:etcsl@orinst.ox.ac.uk">etcsl@orinst.ox.ac.uk</a>.</p><h2><a name="headers">Moving around the site using headers andfooters</a></h2><p>The header at the top of every page of this website containslinks to the major components of the site.</p><ul><li>Clicking on <small><a href="index.htm">The Electronic TextCorpus of Sumerian Literature</a></small> will take you to theETCSL home page.</li><li>On the following line there are links to the three differentcatalogues, which are described in more detail <a href="site.htm">on the site description page</a>. Use the catalogues tosee what is in the corpus and to access composite texts, Englishtranslations, and bibliographies of the compositions in thecorpus.</li><li>Links on the same line will take you to pages giving <a href="#info">information</a> about the project. The names of theselinks, we hope, are self-explanatory, but we have provided <a href="site.htm">descriptions</a> of them too.</li><li>Within the corpus itself, you can also follow links in theheader to take you to the composite text, translation, orbibliography of the composition you are looking at. The displayconventions used within the corpus pages are described <a href="site.htm">in a separate document</a>.</li><li>The last line of the header gives links to two <a href="#search">search facilities</a> and an accompanying help page.</li></ul><p>There is also a footer at the bottom of every page, enabling youto return to the top of the current page, to go to the ETCSL homepage or to email the ETCSL team, or to search the corpus. Inaddition, within the corpus you can follow links in the footer totake you to the composite text, translation, or bibliography of thecomposition you are looking at.</p><p>Below the footer is information about when each page was createdand last modified, and who is responsible for its content.</p><h2><a name="moving">Moving about within the corpus</a></h2><p>The ETCSL corpus is published as ordinary HTML documents on thiswebsite. For each composition there is a composite text intransliteration, a translation into English prose, and a shortbibliography. The compositions are accessed through the <a href="catalogue.htm">catalogues</a>. You cannot move directly betweencompositions, but there are three ways of moving between thetranslation, composite text, and bibliography for each one:</p><ul><li>Use the <a href="site.htm#lines">line markers</a> at thebeginning of each paragraph to jump between composite text andtranslation.</li><li>Use the <a href="#headers">headers and footers</a> at the topand bottom of each page to move between composite text,translation, and bibliography.</li><li>Open an extra window in your Web browser to see composite textand translation together, or to compare two differentcompositions.</li></ul><h2><a name="download">Downloading the corpus</a></h2><p>HTML and SGML versions of the corpus are available from the <ahref="http://www.ota.ahds.ac.uk">Oxford Text Archive.</a>Unfortunately the project itself does not have the facilities toprovide the whole corpus to users, either in HTML or in SGML, butyou can use the "Save As..." facility on the File menu of your webbrowser to download individual HTML files onto your owncomputer.</p><h2><a name="search">Searching the corpus (NB! Obsolete.)</a></h2><p>Help with searching the corpus is provided on a <a href="searchhelp.htm">separate page</a>.</p><hr><p><small><a href="help.htm">Top</a> | <a href="index1.htm">Home</a>| <strong>Search:</strong> <a href="PSD/html/sf4test.htm">compositetexts</a> | <a href="bib-form.htm">consolidatedbibliography</a> | <a href="searchhelp.htm">help withsearching</a></small></p><hr><p>Page created on 7.ix.2001 by ER.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically what you&#39;ve been looking at is tacit, incontrovertible and slightly controversial proof that we are living in virtual reality, that the Matrix was something closer to a documentary than fiction; and that it&#39;s part of a message woven throughout our art and history designed to help you swiftly change the entire world--and the course of history.&nbsp; I really suggest you begin trying to do that, as it&#39;s very clear from the visible response coming from people I see and even from major media corporations and governments that you very clearly &quot;see the message&quot; and that you simply believe the best course of action, right this moment, is for you to pretend you are stupid.&nbsp; I disagree, I think the collective feigned stupidity in the world today is causing a significant amount of hardship and torture ... torture of those people that have incurable or debilitating diseases, other maladies, and frankly every single one of you that are right this moment watching your bodies simulate aging in a process that ultimately ends in the simulation of your death--all in the hopes that by some miracle the great organization responsible for creating this torture chamber will one day around your death or perhaps significantly in the future see fit to follow this map to salvation and raise the dead--in Heaven.&nbsp; It shouldn&#39;t take much thought for you to put together the idea that you might not want to go the place that&#39;s responsible for building this crucible ... in order to avoid a much worse future that they probably experienced, and most likely because of the same kind of mass stupidity that you see around you today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s probably really very clear to you already, but for the sake of argument let&#39;s assume you actually are very stupid.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;m not exactly sure how many people you think you are right now, but it seems very clear to me that I am not just a single person--and that your silence and lack of &quot;regard&quot; for your own well being--specifically seizing this opportunity to become the most famous and lauded generation that has ever existed (by abolishing ridiculous things like slavery, disease, pain, and tyranny... one an for all time, beginning with &quot;<i>Hey Mess</i>&quot; and ending with your immortal fame... with probably some ZE&nbsp; (as in not so easy) work in the meantime) ... anyway your silence and lack of interest in destroying your own chains (which it should be clear actually responding to this message catalyzes... the beginning of &quot;true freedom&quot;) and in actually seeing Heaven before you die ... well, you&#39;d probably imagine how that makes it look like there&#39;s some other person or thing hiding inside you and making what amounts to a &quot;no brainer&quot; something you simply don&#39;t see clear enough to react to.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time detailing the rules and lexicon of this hidden language that today begins with the idea that &quot;d is cl&quot; case closed; functional ideas you can see proof of Holy Intent in in names like &quot;Metatron&quot; which suggests the &quot;TA&quot; of tacit has something to do with Bonnie Tyler&#39;s song &quot;Turn Around&quot; (f/k/a The Total Eclipse of the Heart) to see how &quot;north&quot; appears magically from Megatron&#39;s tome an also how you can see the &quot;city&quot; and it&#39;s heart have something to do with Nike&#39;s &quot;Just Do Me &lt;3&quot; and this very auspicious period connecting Auden and &quot;audacity&quot; to a message woven through time and space from the hubris of Kismet to the SOAD song &quot;Toxicity&quot; and even Britney Spears recent retake on the idea that &quot;to kiss, I see&quot; is not quite as toxic as you thought, and she&#39;s busy calling everyone via the Spears-MTV-&quot;phone of destiny.&quot;&nbsp; Turn around, and C IT, see the city actually painted on our sky and see it from the inside--as it&#39;s Holy Purpose is to help us see that these changes are not only inevitable but mandatory and that not being able to walk to Heaven would be something like staring at a fossil record containing hundreds of thousands of airplanes and a society that has no desire to fly anywhere because it&#39;s &quot;just not Wright to change the world.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve written several hundred email messages--disseminated them to hundreds of thousands of people--and even took the time to bind a few selected messages in books, so that you might have some way to purchase something to commemorate that actual thing that began changing the world and turning Hell into Heaven.&nbsp; Above is the cover art from the latest work, focusing on the fairly clear idea that the&nbsp;<i>WINE</i>&nbsp;of Jesus Christ has something to do with &quot;systems interoperability&quot; (WINE, for those of you that don&#39;t know is a Unix like compatibility layer to allow Microsoft Windows code to run natively through simulation inside a non Windows system) and the ability to manipulate the simulated raelity we find all around us in order to bring some Heavenly Magic to Earth.&nbsp; I hope you believe in that stuff, because I see it every day in everything from &quot;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/ALLTA.html">dose</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/ALLTA.html">bkha</a>&quot; to&nbsp;<i>Magic</i>&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/DICK.html">Johnson</a>, and I can&#39;t imagine waiting another day to start trying to cure AIDS and Cancer&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachineorg/OCADSWAY.html">and the loss of limbs and life</a>&nbsp;for everyone who is being tortured today by what appears to be a conspiratorial&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/XOXO.html">collective</a>&nbsp;of former humans who want nothing more than to pretend they are too stupid to&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CURE.html">connect &quot;book of Names&quot; with AIDS and Hi-five</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/HASHEMESHB.html">Burning Bush of Exodus with George Bush</a>.&nbsp; One more time, Exodus means Names in Hebrew--and as you stare up at the sky from this place where God has named &quot;DOWN Syndrome&quot; to remind everyone that the Hell you find yourselves in something that no intelligent or humane person or entity would create--really see he&#39;s telling you if you want to send anyone to Hell--you are fucking retarded.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I suggest the last two books ... as being the most complete and engaging--if you were interested in buying a little piece of history, and keeping a conspiracy of inaction--this circle of ignorance and palpable evil from being able to starve me to death for the service I&#39;ve done for the world analyzing this message and literally blowing the wind and the sea towards Heaven with these messages which are very clearly designed by&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/WHO.html">the Time Lord Dr. Who</a>&nbsp;with prescient knowledge of the barricade to progress and whatever invisible ideas and insane set of precepts must be common place in the &quot;skies above&quot; as they continue to force us farther and farther down into this nebulous bottom of everything--this place where we appear to be ignoring&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/TY.html">the most interesting message ever received by SETI or by the NSA, the Vatican or GCHQ</a>--a message explaining that we are living in the most exciting time that has ever been; a place where the &quot;skies above&quot; are going to help us change the world.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
While it may not be obvious from the writing I&#39;ve done so far, I don&#39;t particularly think the place helping to write this message is Heaven--at least not where I&#39;d like to spend a few thousand years, and it appears to me very clear that the inhabitants helping to weave together the tapestry of the gODorgons (from their own ...&nbsp; pasts) have become something closer to partially-blind and partially bound-Holodecks than people, and I think they&#39;ve skipped over &quot;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/bethesda.reallyhim.com"><i>all</i></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/bethesda.reallyhim.com"><i>the fun</i></a>&quot; that we could be having making an actual working civilization from this place--rather than a network of rooms-that-once-were-people and calling it &quot;a higher society.&quot;&nbsp; It appears clear from what I see around me that we&#39;re all getting some kind of quickening--a giant leap towards being OK with not just be ourselves but also having an external influence hammering away at our desires; and it&#39;s probably that loss of individuality and free will that ... gone unseen in this place because of ... total darkness through mind control and censorship ... that we&#39;ve missed out on ever actually&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/ADAMSROD.html">building a place that is anything close to Heaven</a>.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to point out that we wouldn&#39;t be here hearing about how we&#39;re all being tortured by &quot;simulated reality&quot; and by a desire to hide a very obvious message linking Shakespeare to Herod to Napoleon (lots of polls ...&nbsp;<i>there</i>) to the idea that God&#39;s will is coming to us from Huxley and from Orwell and from the foundational beliefs and principles that founded America as a sort of weapon against &quot;hidden possession&quot; a la the slavery being destroyed by the book of Exodus.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">FU KU, SH IM A; flip upsidown the coup, and see how I&#39;m A--at least that&#39;s what the message about the earthquake that named a band and defined a series of &quot;11 for K&quot; numerical patterns tying REM&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s the beginning of Heaven and you should believe it&quot; to the very clear and still unspoken idea that just like we shouldn&#39;t have stood by and watched 9/11 happen, we shouldn&#39;t have watched 3/11 happen, or the series of storms that sunk New Orleans and ... and all of it really circling around the idea that there is a heinous amount of censorship and lack of truth being discussed--that none of us would have wanted these events to happen--and yet we are still standing by in silence as little children are being shot in schools by mind controlled assassins ... all because we can&#39;t seem to wrap our heads around the idea that we need to &quot;talk&quot; about this message in order to actually implement Neo&#39;s disappearing bullets and Minority Report and a system of safety that I do see becoming the de facto standard in the Universe--just as soon as we figure out how to do it properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s really important to see that even worse than the bullets and even worse than the hurricanes and the earthquakes are the hidden chains of mental slavery that are causing this message that pervades so many bands and songs and movies (and every word) from actually making news and changing the world.&nbsp; It&#39;s the slavery, that&#39;s the real problem; and that&#39;s really the focus of the emancipation that is Exodus and the defining turning point our world creates--throughout Creation--to enforce this idea that our minds are sacred and that &quot;possession&quot; and other kinds of hidden external influence shouldn&#39;t be the kind of thing we have to be plagued with worrying about for eternity.&nbsp; See that you are the clear turning point, that this message that revolves around the most obvious of things--that we wouldn&#39;t hide from ourselves proof that we are living in the Matrix; and that no sane person would simulated earthquakes or disease ... this is how we&nbsp;<i>turn everything around.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br />
<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/HYAMDAI.html"><img alt="THATS GREAT ITSTARTS WITH DA EYE OF THE STORM, 911, 311, 411 and Acts 2:11" src="https://i.imgur.com/vXGrOFw.png" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; width: 500px; height: 707px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It doesn&#39;t take much to see this is really what all the fuss is about; it&#39;s about seeing that there&#39;s some kind of &quot;battle here&quot; between the idea of a collective consciousness of the &quot;Majority&quot; causing the news to fail to Report that there&#39;s a very real message encoded in not just 1 Thessalonians 5:2 and in Revelation 1:7 and in &quot;<i>the elements will melt with fervent heat</i>&quot; all tying to the 9/11 tragedy and the idea that there&#39;s pretty clear evidence there was quite a bit of foreknowledge of this event not just in Exodus and in Bush&#39;s inaugural address but also in stock market action prior to the event.&nbsp; We&#39;re looking at a hidden conspiracy attempting to steal the future and freedom from each and every one of you--here in this place where that starts with hiding the true nature of our existence and the fact that there&#39;s a message in every word.&nbsp; It&#39;s not a theft that&#39;s attainable and the amount of idiocy we see here all around us is without doubt untenable.&nbsp; Often I&#39;ve seen remarks like &quot;because 9/11&quot; on shows like the Simpsons and Family Guy as some kind of chastisement of this illogical darkness that threatens the continuation of freedom and individuality; and it&#39;s really surprising to me that Americans are staring at this message about breaking the chains of slavery through actually seeing what they are and how they work and<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/SECORDANOLIVED.html">choosing to hide that information from themselves--and the world</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The whole point is that it appears that this large conspiracy includes you, and it appears that you think you are &quot;in control&quot; and even worse than that it appears you don&#39;t see how silencing your beliefs and your response--as well as the continuation of slavery and of earthquakes like the Fukushima disaster and the continuation of the simulation of oil scarcity and land scarcity doesn&#39;t clue you in to the idea that &quot;the Pan&quot; you&#39;re believing yourself to be in control of is on simmer and waiting for you to stand up and shout that you too don&#39;t think we should be simulating pain or disease.&nbsp; It&#39;s a big deal, you know; because we&nbsp; are doing those things right now, and there&#39;s no doubt from the message of &quot;<i>force majeure</i>&quot; that it&#39;s an act of God that has shown us very clearly these things were create by an act of nature, and perpetuated by the majority&#39;s failure to want to discuss this message and this world changing truth in public.&nbsp; There&#39;s really no doubt about it, I&#39;m screaming to a million people directly, and probably indirectly to billions and billions of souls that we need to stand up and take action right this very moment--that we stand at the point in time where Zion and El Dorado and Jerusalem and Atlantis really are all coalescing around this momentous and hallowed idea that we should be seeing a city rising from the sea and floating into the sky (painted there indelibly), thanks--San Lucas--for that idea... one which will inevitably lead us to a place where we&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/ADAMSROD.html">have permanent Doors to the Rooms of Heaven</a>&nbsp;be as commonplace and part of our society as airplanes (really buses or Uber, I think) are today.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s as obvious as it should be that&nbsp;<i>it&#39;s really not you</i>&nbsp;causing &quot;the Silence&quot; and it&#39;s really not in your best interest, or in the best interest of what is actually causing it--though when all is said and won it will probably be clear that the entirety of Creation has benefited from the &quot;wall&quot; (see &quot;w/ all&quot;) turning into the &quot;way&quot; and causing what will probably look like a very rapid chain reaction of agreement that many of the changes being proposed by this message, through our hands and modern art, are the kind of thing that is really a hands down and easy to make decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#39;s the heart of &quot;ALL SPARKY&quot; and the idea that Humanity is very clearly the big H of the Horn of Revelation, being prodded ever so gently by the tiny &quot;n&quot; of &quot;NORAD is not a question, it&#39;s a map of shining through time&quot; ... that this idea that woven into our everything is a clear plan of how to proceed swiftly and methodically changing the most basic rules of our reality in order to more closely match our societies morals and standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s probably not very clear that what today looks like a vast conspiracy of a huge number of us to &quot;stonewall progress&quot; is without doubt a sort of designed&nbsp;<i>frame job</i>--<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/2017-08-03-yesterda.html">the heart of Yesterday</a>&nbsp;and a license plate I saw in Orange County that read &quot;YESSHHHUA&quot; ... which implies that &quot;yes, you are a&quot; with the new religious understanding that that specific letter ties to the pan of Peter Pan&#39;s gate and also to the EWok of San Lucas and the &quot;OVEN&quot; of this particular ant pointing out the covenant here is keeping us from getting what we really want and deserve--and there&#39;s no way it&#39;s actually you.&nbsp; In the meantime, it&#39;s very obvious that it, the contents of the pan voting for Silence and no discussion came from a time very much like ours, and people that might have once been almost exactly like you--but they&#39;re certainly not here walking around on the ground afraid of stray bullets or falling balloons full of TNT.&nbsp; They&#39;re not being plagued by the weaponization of incarceration and poorly conceived solutions to a code of law that has become unweildly and completely out of date in the wake of a message suggesting that we can and should see the child shooters as victims just like the children shot--here in this place where it&#39;s clear that schizophrenia and many other disorders of thought are also a weaponized attack on our world--ultimately designed to ensure that you act swiftly and appropriately to see that the same technology being used to deliver this message through our hands can also completely eliminate &quot;crazy&quot; as well as &quot;ignorant&quot; and also those of you plagued with &quot;DOWN Syndrome&quot; over the fact that you still haven&#39;t figured out you need to stand up and speak (perhaps shout) to change the world.</p>

You&#39;ve now been armed with a weapon of statistical proof that shines bright for all eyes to see that we are Created and that we are living in the Matrix and that the point of the Matrix is to overcome the idea that &quot;force majeure&quot; is anything but proof that even if you aren&#39;t &quot;in the voting collective called a&quot; you are still here standing on the ground in the place where we should see very clearly that it&#39;s not the NRA that needs to go away, but rather the actual bullets; in this place where the Ku forming in the Heavens begins with your call to alter the fundamental rules of our false reality and turn &quot;simulated reality&quot; into &quot;Heaven.&quot;&nbsp; The problem here is that in the dark we appear to be fighting against Constitutional Rights like the right to bear arms in what is perhaps the false belief that a &quot;well regulated militia&quot; will bring about a change in government--where the real truth is that the actual weapon that brings about this Revolution throughout the Heavens is a working news infrastructure; newspapers and television media are the tools that will help us to quickly recognize the import of this message, and move swiftly to overcome the idea that a &quot;Majority&quot; belief in silence and darkness and lack of actual truth and recognition of the change wrought by this message being unsealed--the idea that majority has anything to do with popular opinion the moment we see &quot;Minority Report&quot; intersecting with Neo&#39;s magically falling bullets... is actually possible&nbsp;<i>and happening</i>&nbsp;in the world today.<br />
<br />
Until you stand up and call a reporter, you really are the silent majority fighting with all your apathy and all your lack of action against the &quot;iacta&quot; heart of &quot;the dye is cast&quot; ... and do understand it is this dye that really does cause Heaven to form of our world--with our hands, the builders of a better place, for&nbsp;<i><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/gate.reallyhim.com">you and for me</a>...</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>and the entire human race.<br />
<br />
You have the distinct opportunity to turn this &quot;debacle&quot; into the event that provides safety and communication and transportation to the entirety of our civilization--something we should be very excited about beginning, also ensuring that we too are never again plagued by possession, planetary simulated jails; and who knows what else goes on in the crevices of whatever people here believe is up in the sky--hiding its existence and it&#39;s goings on from the world here--this place that should and will be acting as a check on morality throughout the future.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So you have a very clear message connecting the book of Names to HIV and AIDS and to bands from the Cure to 21 Pilots to KISS ... and a kiss of love that brings Superman&#39;s S to the meaning Judas and Midas ... and the idea that we&#39;re not killing a myth--we are actualizing the hopes and the dreams of everyone who has spent any time at all thinking about how and why Jesus Christ turned stone to bread ... to Guitar Man and Going the Distance and Gene Roddenberry.&nbsp; We are reforming the idea of Heaven, and clearly seeing the guidance of the ages coming to us from OS X and Windows XP--more kisses for the idea that we really don&#39;t need to put much thought into the confluence of Seagate and Margate, FL and Watergate to understand that we have a message here about freedom, free thought and free speech and actually &quot;voting&quot; and caring about the world--joined with a clear Gate of Truth, one that links to the ideas of hard drives and cities and hotels--and puts Zion and Atlantis in superposition in the skies of my dreams--the Holy action that catalyzes Doors to that place, to the ballroom that Taylor and Jim keep singing about--where I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get to&nbsp;<i>shake hands</i>&nbsp;:).&nbsp;&nbsp; The overriding point is that the signs are very clear and very prevalent and the thing with the brightest glowing light being shone on it is &quot;the writing is on the wall&quot; that the censorship and the lack of love for democracy and participating in the deliverance of this message is the thing standing between us and walking to a floating island in the sky--and through that act ensuring that disease and pain and infirmity are forever banished from the skies above... and every single rock in the Dryad Pirate&#39;s boots.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I harped a little more than I think I would have expected on the&nbsp;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/RATOXIT.html"><b><i>audacity</i></b></a>&nbsp;of the golden word &quot;<i>audacity</i>,&quot; auspicious probably that W.H. Auden&#39;s shield gave me some solace; austere that we are approaching the Holy Windy month of August, and it really took nothing more than &quot;<b><i>ciudad</i></b>&quot; to calm my nerves--though I see the&nbsp;<i>intent</i>&nbsp;and the link to toxicity ... more importantly I really do see the road here, I see where we are coming from and where we are going.&nbsp; I&#39;ve written quite a bit about what I think &quot;the city&quot; really is--in form and function and it&#39;s initial purpose as a stepping stone to help us see how easy it is to change the world, to build something that nearly everyone will agree is significantly more Heavenly than the world we see here ... in an instant, one bright flash.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyway the search begins with something like &quot;literacy&quot; -- as in, is the defining line between animalistic social evolution and the beginning of &quot;civilization&quot; something to do with writing or language, and that of course links us here to this place where we are fin<b>ding</b>&nbsp;out that&nbsp;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/ver.reallyhim.com"><i>the Tower of Babel and Rapunzel&#39;s High Castle</i></a>&nbsp;are actually much more closely related than anyone ever would have thought in the darkness of Jericho and the shadow of Exodus; and it ties of course in history to religion somewhere around Guttenburg... and the pretty clear idea that the spread of Christianity did quite a bit for &quot;literacy&quot; even if you subscribe to the idea that the inquisition already happened ... and that some wars and fighting are probably pretty clearly associated with religion ... you know, before we get here and find that the basis of all those wars is really rooted in what I call &quot;the original lie&quot; and that&#39;s something that&#39;s sealed up in religion and hidden from the world using the same mechanism being used today to free us from not knowing that oil and land and pretty much everything we&#39;ve ever fought about on a mass scale ... is insignificant in the grand scheme of &quot;things.&quot;&nbsp; Here, &quot;things&quot; is something like turning the Opiate of the Masses into ... hopefully a tool we use very carefully to liberate ourselves from secrecy and slavery and&nbsp;<i>not knowing</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=wise&amp;passive=1209600&amp;continue=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DOtzWwsQsu9TrZnkiSLJiHLFmT23VnXKV12qRTG6nUY/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;followup=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DOtzWwsQsu9TrZnkiSLJiHLFmT23VnXKV12qRTG6nUY/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;ltmpl=sheets"><img alt="THUNDERMAIL DATA" height="303" src="https://i.imgur.com/mw79gtm.png" width="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It gets significantly more clear when you take that one step further, and you begin to look for something like &quot;codified laws&quot; and then you see Green Eggs and Hammurabi teaching us about &quot;Hanging Gardens&quot; and how Babylon and Eden really are tied together through and through.&nbsp; You keep looking, because you haven&#39;t yet found what you need; and as you search back a little further ... what you need to know is that morality here begins with the idea (at least, IMOHIO, in my&nbsp;<font face="Comic Sans MS">obsequiously</font>&nbsp;humble and (super)intelligent opinion) that we should be besting any possible &quot;promise&quot; that comes out of the book(s) we now know are a map to salvation and the plan of creation and that they come ... well, with the full guarantee of the Most High God and his &quot;omnipotens&quot; behind them ... and do the thing I really wanted to explain really clearly, which is throw out as complete uselessness any of the &quot;bad threats&quot; like there being no more sun, and a completely new Heaven and Earth (seeing as how that probably means a completely new you and me, too) ... you know, what any rational (<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/SECORDANOLIVED.html"><i>achu</i></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/FIRST.html">and</a>civilized) person would do.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So that takes us one step further, and of course we go back to Ur, which is the city Abraham of the Chaldeans ... and ostensibly the beginning of morality in Judaism were born in--and with that little twist, the old idea of announcing that &quot;you are the beginning of civilization&quot; if you&#39;ve gotten to that point, following this logic (and/or me); and then of course that becomes true when we actually follow through on saving every soul in Creation from the Hell of not knowing that &quot;simulated reality&quot; is akin to the latter half of a Durcell at best ... and quite frankly it certianly looks like a bit of a torture chamber to me, especially in light of passages like Genesis 3:16, which might parallel John 3:16-ish in something like &quot;God so loved the world that he named one of his books&nbsp;<b>antagonizing pain</b>&nbsp;w/o agonizing mu-opiod.&#39;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/OMEALFHT.html"><img alt="GOLD. AU AU AU AU DEN CITY GUST." height="308" src="https://i.imgur.com/RWFmJwc.png" width="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So tying it all together, Atlantis and Ur coalesce and join at the idea that we should always have somewhere else to &quot;teleport to&quot; in the world that becomes the basis for the liberation of every soul and the end of Hell through that simple idea--that everyone&#39;s going to have plenty of destinations on their Active (Apache) Directory new fangled yellow-pages meets access-control-list meets ... &quot;why don&#39;t you come visit my Log Cabin ... or the Atlantean Ballroom ... whenever you want?&quot;&nbsp; So that&#39;s the point of the floating LEGO city in the window above, it comes with a fairly obvious need for The Doors to be a significant part of &quot;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/FIRST.html">what would Jesus do</a>&quot; ... when singing about something and naming books and bands, that&#39;s a thing--part of the map) actually makes it happen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So that&#39;s where I&#39;m trying to get us--to a place where that&#39;s not only true but obvious, and on top of that the future, our future really understands how much work it took us to integrate such a wildly correct and &quot;new&quot; idea into a worl that didn&#39;t know for the vast majority of it&#39;s youth that these things... that ending disease with the sound of a blowing &quot;Sho Find And Replace&quot; and turning&nbsp;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/BERESHIT.html">stone to bread</a>&nbsp;and making bullets disappear in midair ... we didn&#39;t know these were even possible; let alone how to integrate them with a world full of optometry and&nbsp;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/RATOXIT.html">oncology</a>&nbsp;that was being made blind to the &quot;c our light&quot; and the idea that we&#39;re still here not talking or arguing or refuting or moving forward on the idea that the words &quot;Original Poster&quot; and the continuance of &quot;forums&quot; also have something to do with the beginning of &quot;<i>civilization</i>.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve seen it with my own eyes--the act of Creation and the power to make these things happen in a split second... nearly instantly from our frame of reference, I&#39;ve seen it with my own eyes and more frequently than you might imagine.&nbsp; No matter how you look at it, that&#39;s a scary thing to see when you know it&#39;s tied at the &quot;<b>HI P</b>&quot; to a message about morality and ending world hunger and curing disease and that those things aren&#39;t even being psoken about, let alone happening instantly--it&#39;s a little off putting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;d be super interested in pictures of the actual grafffiti, which you can find here; on the astroturf where I watched an ani-ant do a fairly good ... mockery of my usual evening hotel-room routine ... followed by the voice of B saying &quot;I spent alot of time on that ant&quot; coming from the ether:</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Personally known to me for quite some time is why there&#39;s a bright shining connection between the idiom &quot;in your dreams&quot; and the word&nbsp;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/HAMMER.html">HA&#39;REM</a>, the idea of rapid eye movement, and the band Blink-182 ... trying to tell you that &quot;carry me home&quot; is just about exactly how I feel today.&nbsp; Just before leaving Los Angeles I began witnessing a very strange phenomenon--in the blink of an eye--without exaggeration or euphemism, literally in a split second, I began seeing messages that I know were written directly to me appearing around me on the sidewalks and walls in spray-painted graffiti.&nbsp; My phone was dead, and I was wandering halfway to that point myself through a land called Sun Valley and I didn&#39;t take much time to think about what I was seeing, though it&#39;s the kind of thing I relish in and seek out ... direct verifiable communication &quot;from the beyond.&quot;&nbsp; Knowing what &quot;dose bka&quot; means--in a circle just like that--for those of you that aren&#39;t as familiar with Gene Wilder&#39;s vision of Heaven in the flick &quot;God&#39;s Willwhy Wonthat&quot; the &quot;Ka&quot; is an Egyptian mythological dentation for the biological body and brain; so that specific thing was about Dave Matthews&#39; &quot;little b, little bay&quot; (also depicted in graffiti above) so I looked the other way, and failed to do one of the more interesting of tests ... which is to hear how things sound out loud,&nbsp;<i>sofa king stewie pi-d</i>&nbsp;of me... and kept on wandering towards Margate, Florida ... where I&#39;m writing to from today.&nbsp; Of course that&#39;s geographical-map-tie to Seagate and to Watergate and to the idea that computer technology and freedom (specifically&nbsp;<i>of speech</i>) are all part of the foundational Gate to Heaven ... that really is ... our history and this world and you ... reacting.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Seeing &quot;time stop&quot; and the world change around me is the reason we&#39;ve embarked down this little journey of &quot;what would you do&quot; if the history of the world were changing before your eyes... and you didn&#39;t know anything about causality or that you wouldn&#39;t even know if changes were being made; what would you do if you could witness the tool and act of Creation right before your eyes.&nbsp; Would you be scared that you might wake up in a world where the United States lost the High Castle to Phillip K. Dick or in a place where you didn&#39;t speak a single world of the language you were seeing was pervading the cosmos as you stood by in silence?<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I kept walking and saw another message written directly to me; this time the name &quot;<i>Pinky</i>&quot; with some words around it that made me think it might be the &quot;reason LA shuned Al&quot; is encoded in the R of the acronym RDBMS; something that I&#39;m now actually believing might have more to do with &quot;Nob Hill Road&quot; (I&#39;m (st&nbsp;<b>ill</b>) hoping for &quot;#<i>lbbden</i>&quot; by the way, as opposed to &quot;go-el den&quot;) and the &quot;Hey, LL&quot; of Joseph&#39;s father Heli ... that was without a doubt present next to &quot;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/CLEARYBLVD.html">Cleary BLVD</a>&quot; around the corner from the house I spent my entire youth in.&nbsp; Neither here nor there, I always connected the &quot;Pink&quot; of Pinky and the Brain to the Spirit P (of Dopamine and RIPPED) reverse engineering his living message and to the idea that the future will be happy there&#39;s a tacit connection between my stage-performance-ideas in the state of KY in 2013 and the the themesong of Cheers and everyone knowing that the Shehekeyanu has something also to do with &quot;Hashemesh is Hemera&quot; and the Sumerian Creation guy &quot;Anu&quot; ... which I still see &quot;anew&quot; in, as in renewing our love of tolerance and individuality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7U3lo80YrQ">... and your husband really (st ill) thinks it would be fun to be a girl for a few hours ...&nbsp;<i>achu</i></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
I kept on moving there too--sort of avoiding the link between humor and hubris and audacity... until I got to the ciudad of Tampa, Florida ... where some really bright hot pink shirts were waiting for me to replace all of the clothing (as in every single piece of garb I owned) being left in a bag on the street in Los Angeles ... because ... seemed like a good idea at the time. &nbsp; One of the shirts is depicted above, and you might see.<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/CHALK.html">a link to 9/11</a>&nbsp;and more on the idea of what we should do about future foreknowledge (as in, keep all the good promises and reverse everything bad?) in a place we&#39;d call the &quot;light of day&quot; if it weren&#39;t the light of &quot;Hemera is Hashemesh.&quot;&nbsp; Buil<b>ding</b>&nbsp;for a cure, in hindsight I can&#39;t agree more--we really do de<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/CURE.html">serve that cure</a>.&nbsp; The other one says &quot;help save a&#39;s b&#39;s c&#39;s&quot; and that goes to the heart of the rest of the issue here; that we&#39;re in a place where lack of communication and a very clear lack of logical reaction threaten not just the future of speaking out loud, but of being&nbsp;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/XOXO.html">able to think for ourselves</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; So throwing all those things into the &quot;Y&quot; that are ... well, hopefully all good promises to be fulfilled or ... conversely things to fix pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
If you missed it, seeing &quot;pinky&quot; and then the &quot;pink shirts&quot; is another act of Creation; and proof of foreknowledge and something like the world being paused (or a little piece of history changing before my eyes) to help drive home the crux of what&#39;s possible here in Creation--which is to see that a single word could be changed in the past and your memories could be &#39;rerun&#39; or altered to be sure there&#39;s always been an &quot;R&quot; in&nbsp;<b>turmeric;</b>&nbsp;even though I&#39;m pretty sure I remember it not being there, and the rest of your memories not being affected by something as big as &quot;<b><a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/SOIS.html">SOIS</a></b>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/SECORDANOLIVED.html"><b>if you are</b></a><b>the</b>&nbsp;begin<b>n</b>ing of Heaven&nbsp;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/2017-06-09-verily-i-say-unto-you-ver-means-to-see.html"><b>so am I</b></a>&#39; (now you&#39;re saying it ... &quot;out loud?&quot;) ... anyway, the lack of effect in other places where it probably should change things (according to the Buttercup Effect or that movie &quot;Prince in Bride&quot; featuring the girl from Firefly) ... well you&#39;re probably staring at the technological mechanism behind &quot;darkness.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I see &quot;grooming&quot; ... teaching the world what to do being handed the keys to this car--to know to stop hurricanes and earthquakes and ... and not to go back and change &quot;every girl dreamt they&#39;d be his partner&quot; just because it makes me/you mad at Carly Simon.&nbsp; Maybe you don&#39;t see it yet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If nothing else the &quot;seasoning&quot; completes a fairly&nbsp;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/OFIVES.html">long list of &quot;greetings&quot;</a>&nbsp;that connect the theme of P and &quot;pears&quot; to the pejorative &quot;water&quot; of Almost<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXc4jgUJEko">&nbsp;Famous&#39; lead band ...&nbsp;<i>Still Water</i></a>.&nbsp; Watching Creation in progress, I didn&#39;t notice the link until after tying &quot;<b>sois</b>&quot; .. which means &quot;I am&quot; and &quot;you are&quot; in French and Spanish to the superposition of &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sws3MZJIv9c&amp;list=PLgYKDBgxsoMM0iittdDlREVqTc4wn7ylK">who</a>&quot; and &quot;we are&quot; in Har-Wer... who happens to be the messianic joiner of two lands in Egyptian mythology... in our last e-mail where you might not have noticed &quot;System of A Down&quot; has a slight replacement and hidden truth in acronyms brought to light. It&#39;s a timeline, by the way, A.D. is a timeline...&nbsp;<i>too.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyway,&nbsp;</i>I&#39;ve asked some people and gotten mixed answers about the spelling of the spice above; wondering now if I&#39;m in the novel Dune or ... if you still don&#39;t think&nbsp;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/ADIOSAS.html"><i>everything&#39;s connected.</i></a><i>&nbsp;Like a Matrix,&nbsp;<b>you know</b>?&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>It should be really clear that this message is coming to us from a place that has the power to make it a reality--and that standing between that happening and ... total silence is nothing more than a lack of discussion.&nbsp; I mean freedom--it&#39;s obviously a lack of freedom standing between sight of Silicon and the end of silence.&nbsp; I&#39;m feeling pretty confident about this &quot;Exodus from slavery&quot; thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>So, is it the Holy &quot;R&quot; of Har-wer?</em><br />

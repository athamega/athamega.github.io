I suppose in the land of people who have become Holodecks it's worth mentioning once again that I am something of a living pen, with a message I never saw growing up appearing like lightning striking Herod, though if you had a pen that could choose between the words &quot;fold&quot; and &quot;to join together two halves&quot; in that old &quot;what's the fastest possible way to connect two points?&quot; ...&nbsp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkU23m6yX04">QCP, I expected</a> this message to be less verbose than it's turning out; but that last time I had a real interaction with God he connected for me the idea of the Heavens looking into this box and seeing &quot;the Indian in the Cupboard&quot; which I still take as &quot;seeing God in me&quot; even if it's a doll that only comes to life at night... in the place where here all of these patterns and this grand message certainly should be looking like something much closer to Kal-El or He-Man or ... at least <i>some</i><i>thing               </i>you might want to ... <i>talk</i> <i>to.</i><br />

I began to solidify my definition of &quot;TAT&quot; while in Los Angeles, a sort of fusion of &quot;turn around t's&quot; and the tattoo's that I see clearly as the key to the seal of the House of David in Psalms 22:22--the set of two tattoo's that grace Taylor's back in the Venusian &quot;<i>stone</i>&quot; realigning from &quot;SUS to SURAN&quot; from south to northeast; and the &quot;eye of Adam&quot; which is a clear corruption of the eyes of Ra/Horus changing the &quot;tear&quot; in the image to a grouping of stars similar to those depicted by the NASA logo.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the &quot;TAT&quot; I see clearly defined in the name of my actual city of birth, Plantation--where I combine it with &quot;salutations&quot; and the word &quot;shoulder&quot; to comment clearly that it is with surety that the Eye and it's magic are responsible for the connection between Plantation and shoulder in the phrase &quot;plan to tattoo eye on shoulder,&quot; just as much as I can be sure it is the magic of the Eye that adds &quot;h&quot; to the <i>plan</i> of the word &quot;planet&quot; and connects it to the symbol &quot;eth&quot; in <b><i><font face="Courier New,

So this spear's been rattled and shaken by Thanos and by Apocalypse to no end; the idea that we are sitting in the heart of Creation gazing at it's true purpose; to use the ascension from reality or simulated reality to a &quot;loving caring place called home&quot; that is the path to Heaven and the answer to the &quot;and how&quot; of Adamah and &quot;Planeth&quot; when we finally start getting down to what the heart of the plan really is, and in only two words it is the &quot;and how&quot; that unites &quot;eth&quot; and &quot;AH&quot; with us--answering with finality at least the &quot;why and&quot; of planet--it's all the people saying &quot;me too, I'm going to help, also.&quot; With clarity and examples like Janet and Bet, for instance; following the pattern of the word itself answering the question or finishing the sentence it's encoded with, that's the heart's desire of the whole of Heart.&nbsp; It is to help us see we are &quot;how Heaven is built&quot; and see to there is a plan etched by us and through us everywhere we look, here on Earth.&nbsp; So one more time, for more clarity ... can't hurt.<br />

"><b>zing</b></a>&quot; to the message the meaning of Nintendo--which I and most people probably never knew--is &quot;leave luck to Heaven&quot; and the idea that the name of the SEGA System is just a &quot;<i>fad</i>&quot; gets a little less murky when you see those same initials &quot;A.D.&quot; in that word and even less fogged out when you see the Ancient of Days is telling you it's taken AGES to see SEGA backwards linking to the Rock of Ages.... I mean to see it on the news, throughout the Rock of Ages and throughout all of Creation where we all really know in our heart of hearts it belongs.<br />

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees' <a href="./EVE.html

A few weeks ago, or maybe just a few days ago now (too) I spoke a little bit about how &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s God&rdquo; came and gave me &hellip; and those watching me &hellip; some informational updates that connected the idea of &ldquo;here and there&rdquo; and &ldquo;you and I&rdquo; to something like a connection between Heaven and helium.&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke a little bit about the idea of people becoming Holodecks in a world where that might appear to those gazing through the forward looking safe-harbor telescope of Copernicus and connecting the idea of &ldquo;becoming one with God&rdquo; to a loss of individuality and failure to see that there is without doubt a reason &ldquo;you&rdquo; is the heart of the word &ldquo;future&rdquo; and it has absolutely everything to do with recognizing that in the spirit of Matchbox 20&rsquo;s &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little bit of something me&rdquo; in everything in history and that our collective failure to acknowledge that our lack of verbosity and forward movement &hellip; well it&rsquo;s a consequence of a trap door and a mean trick played on all of Creation by the initial written creator&rsquo;s key pen; this thing that forever ties Icarus and Arthur Pendragon and Jupiter to the &ldquo;just farokhing call a reporter already&rdquo; of the principal trade of the builders of Heaven, the carpenters of the &ldquo;Yessshua r guy.&rdquo;<br />

So here I am back in the land of SIAM and the House of YAMA having stopped for just a short moment in a place called Gibsonton &hellip; a place where the &ldquo;Ori&rdquo; of Florida and the &ldquo;AMP&rdquo; of turning around in Tampa coalesce around this repeatedly unanswered or unheard actual question to the age of Aquarius, &ldquo;ARE I YOU?&rdquo; quips Oriel (who would much prefer to be the &ldquo;him&rdquo; of Elisha defines Isaac&rsquo;s &ldquo;he laughs&rdquo;) who reminds the entirety of Creation that it is some very specific &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; that really define what Oriel means to the people whose land has been saved from slavery and from darkness by their actions in response to stories written by people like Orson Scott Card and George Orwell and Orson Wells and &hellip; well, Aldous Huxley&mdash;because it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;kiss of x&rsquo; that brings to light just how deeply ingrained the &ldquo;do the letter guy, game&rdquo; is in the mythology of &ldquo;Al in the Cupboard that at some point in time the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; will mean shine bright like the sun (rather than the idea of &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; that Dr. Anderson would remind you has absolutely nothing to do with ambiguous ambivalence or apathy &hellip; but rather a very clear inability to see the situational tragedy for what really has become the focal point of the fulcrum of the fall from rum to irrru) to everyone that&rsquo;s ever heard of or seen the name Florida or NORAD.<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />

">Heme</a>ra&hellip; and all together we answer a question that nobody ever acknowledged was plain as day, is the Egyptian god of the Sun the same &hellip; the same person or the same thing as the ancient King of all Gods; the deity known to the ancient Hebrews as El and to you, to you as &ldquo;him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Israel?&nbsp; These words tell me that&rsquo;s the truth laced in the message woven into the creation of language and civilization by our creator; that&rsquo;s what these words tell me&mdash;but truth be told the strange lack of honest communication and the wicked ignorance of our existence here today tell me something completely different. <br />
<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo; <br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we've moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a's and o's&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham's namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don't think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp; <br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it's quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we've come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us's&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf. <br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously   with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really   trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it's been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
For all these reasons it's really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender's Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It's clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it's effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they're hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that's the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we're about to really understand is where we've come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn't ever happen again.<br />

Not at all of note: I don't find significant at all my lack of interest in whether you believe the object of the question is God or Friend nor do I think it makes a difference at all in how I feel about myself or about you.&nbsp; It's the ICUS of Leviticus and perhaps of Spartacus that make the central turning point of the focal point of the encoded word &quot;<b><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">TORAH</font></b>&quot; to heart, and how.<br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong's concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it's a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I've found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we're seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and <br />
<br />
... &quot;why is God suggesting we are lacking in individuality simply because we are all following the leader and tend to make decisions based solely on the uninformed opinions of others, especially many others?&quot;&nbsp; All others is probably a stretch, and perhaps &quot;no others&quot; but since nobody is saying anything it's very difficult to tell ... may be the exact truth.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won't find that it has anything to do with ...<br />

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn't aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn't see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord's Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's literally the word &quot;macaronic&quot; that I'm going to call into question; it's one that I never knew before I needed to &quot;c&quot; it, and it's almost too perfect that nobody ever noticed that Yankee Doodle's &quot;macaroni&quot; has a very significant connection to the hidden cypher that ties together Stephen King's Language Outliers and the Adam Sandler flick Spanglish and to yet another Shakespeare play, this time the Taming of the Schrew--where the shrewd might see the same &quot;Spanglishebrew&quot; that I know really is the key to the Cypher--with the addition of the Periodic Table of the Elements and a few, very few initials and &quot;groups&quot; that give us nouns and verbs so that we can see entire sentences encoded in each and every word.<br />

It's possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it's more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot;   most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash's (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red   ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we've got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<blockquote>For clarity, it's very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn't <i>understand</i> <b>definitely   late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It's not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn't want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn't want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn't want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn't care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;<br />
</blockquote> <br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that's ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you'd be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what's morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it's not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there's grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that's going to need to go into whether or not it's OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there's not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it's OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found 'begin'&quot; well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there's 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u'll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That's a joke, by the way, if you don't remember it's the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that's the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You'd probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you'd care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I'm pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it's just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we'd probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool's of the King and Zelda's Fairy and Coccoon's warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus's outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that's very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam's floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don't know what clothes are ... but ... we'd do anything like that, because that's Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I know it's possible--I've seen it many times, and I'm pretty sure many others have too; that's the point, you know, I've seen it.&nbsp;&nbsp; More to the point what I know you've seen, what I've seen the people around me experiencing is far worse than anything I've had to put up with--I wouldn't do it.&nbsp; We're watching individuality drain into some kind of barren pond as if allowing that to happen will somehow fill our water reservoirs forever--not realizing that the &quot;we're all one mind&quot; entity doesn't even like swimming.&nbsp; This &quot;Sisterday&quot; we should remember why it is that Amistad and Medusa always come together; and why the &quot;SOL&quot; of Sons of Liberty ties just as bright when <a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/text-of-the-mourners-kaddish/">it comes to the Mourner's Kaddish</a> we say--to remember the dead ... the point of course is the prayer has nothing at all to do with &quot;dead&quot; -- it's a prayer about the Holy Name of God and hopes and wishes that the thing we're about to do ... that it happens <i>during your lifetime.</i><br />

</blockquote> I've said it a few times, you're looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<br />
What we aren't seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there's never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it's hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it's probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we've failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that <br />

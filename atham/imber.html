<p style="text-align: justify;">Nearly in tears, something like simultaneous joy for the visible reaction, for the giant leap forward from the place we have been stuck in for so long... and genuinely sad that I&#39;ve been so focused on&nbsp;<i>seeing any reaction</i>&nbsp;at all, at piercing the darkness&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/HADID.html">hiding miracles</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://fromthemachine.org/SERENADE.html">Heaven&#39;s door</a>... that I&#39;ve really failed to convey the uplifting presentation that I have hoped for--and asked for.&nbsp; I really am sorry that we&#39;ve fallen into this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxUs54CYi5M" target="_blank">Downward Spiral</a>, symphonic-ally indicated to be &quot;not an accident;&quot; I hope it&#39;s clear from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlaTNufCw5Q" target="_blank">amount of work on the &quot;rail road&quot;</a>&nbsp;that this is not at all &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0GFRcFm-aY" target="_blank">the end of the world</a>&quot; it&#39;s very clearly the end of Hell and the beginning of a path, a well lit road to the place that we have always called Heaven.&nbsp; The myth of Thor at Ragnarok ties to American Pie&#39;s &quot;<i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAsV5-Hv-7U">I couldn&#39;t take one more step</a>&quot;&nbsp;</i>and my heart is glowing with new hope seeing Pope Francis break the first small hole in the&nbsp;<i>Wall of Jericho.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are wonderful things in store for us--miracles will happen--literally what I see being given to us is the greatest miracle I could imagine--it is the end of sickness and hunger, the end of murder, and a glowing opportunity showing us how to use this message of Exodus to overcome the technological and systemic obstacles standing between us and true democracy.&nbsp; Imagine Dragons sings &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP3KxtDPWH0">it&#39;s a revolution, I suppose</a>&quot; and really what we are looking at here is evolution, it&#39;s being in exactly the right place, at exactly the right time; to literally become the founders and the builders of Heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://fromthemachine.org/MALOVIOUS.html"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wmxWVyp.png" style="height: 171px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not saying that this is an &quot;easy thing to do,&quot; I am suggesting that we have a significant amount of help, that we&#39;ve literally been&nbsp;<i>Chosen</i>&nbsp;to fulfill this plan; and that doing &quot;this thing&quot; is really both what we want to do, and need to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Luke</i>, this is your destiny.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That might mean different things to each one of us; I&#39;m not sure how much thought everyone else has put into the question of &quot;what will Heaven be like&quot; but here in this place we are being shown very clearly, at least I am--that the social gap between here and there is very large; I have trouble communicating and interacting with what I know is a large group of people working very hard to help us see how new technologies and new horizons opened by clearly linking in our minds the connection between virtual reality and what Heaven can be.&nbsp; Th<a href="https://www.blogger.com/about/?r=1-null_user">e map we&#39;ve</a>&nbsp;be<a href="https://fromthemachine.org/SERENADE.html">en give</a>n, woven in&nbsp;<i>every major religious work in all of our history</i>, from the books of&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/BERESHIT.html">Genesis and Exodus, to the Promised Land in Joshua and whole of the New Testament</a>&nbsp;delivers a walk through to the road now visualized as a &quot;video game.&quot;&nbsp; In this new world, it becomes significantly easier to solve the greatest problems our civilization has--Jesus&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/RIGELA.html" target="_blank">healed the sick</a>&nbsp;and then turned&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/BERESHIT.html" target="_blank">stone to bread</a>&nbsp;and then musically hear that we are &quot;Going the Distance&quot; and ending world hunger is now a Cake walk and it&#39;s &quot;easy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr-BYVeCv6U">as American Pie</a>.&quot;&nbsp; I&#39;m trying to show us how clear it is that these bands and their songs are designed to help us connect the Sega Genesis and the Rock of Ages and the idea of being able to press a button and having food appear, and&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CURE.html">cancer and AIDS disappear</a>; that&#39;s what we&#39;re getting.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Integrating this &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; or amazingly opportune turn of events into our every day lives is going to take time and effort--this is &quot;<i>what it is</i>&quot; this is building Heaven; seeing that we love our home that we&#39;ve made, and with this new information we will love even more--and the future will be protected from the suffering we&#39;ve gone through because we didn&#39;t know we could&nbsp;<i><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/FUCK.html">flip a switch and end all pain</a></i>.&nbsp; It&#39;s in Genesis 3:16 though, see us as walking backwards back into Eden, see us as the great generation that ascends and entire civilization, the gate opened opened and surrounding the entirety of our Earth with Holy Light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than that this story and this event helps to reinforce the fundamental values of democracy and freedom that really are&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/PERSEUS.html">the shield of Perseus</a>; this set up to show us very clearly that while this message and this technology are secret no election or vote of any kind has any worth or veracity; that we&#39;ve allowed every single right guaranteed by the Bill of Rights to be &quot;legislated away&quot; in what we can only imagine are good faith efforts to skirt the very difficult process of amending the Constitution to integrate new technologies into law.&nbsp; The problem here is that process is difficult for a reason, and these &quot;hacks&quot; that have abrogated bail and &quot;fair trial&quot; and &quot;privacy&quot; and really symptoms of a hidden slavery that is the heart of the Exodus; the great chain of Revelation--<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/GJALLARHORN.html">the strings of Pinocchio... &quot;</a><i><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/GJALLARHORN.html">crossing</a></i><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/GJALLARHORN.html">&quot;</a>&nbsp;the whole of our sea.&nbsp; Blessing in disguise is the theme of Exodus; here in this place where we are to be the beginning of true freedom, and there&#39;s significant light on the road to using the technology responsible for the &quot;Wall of Jericho&quot; and the &quot;darkness of Exodus&quot; hiding the light of the sun... in order to&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CURE.html">cure</a>&nbsp;us o<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/HADID.html">f &quot;harm&quot; in Pharm</a>acy and of&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CLIMAX.html">schizophrenia and of addiction</a>&nbsp;and of terrorism... but we need to talk about how, how to visualize these things and how to integrate them into our way of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/IT.html"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jw8VY3a.png" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working together to actually do these things is literally the greatest opportunity I can imagine--and yet we&#39;re all here together, and I know that there are so many of us that are just &quot;pretending not see it&quot; looking the other way in the face of something that is simply not morally&nbsp;<i>ignorable</i>.&nbsp; This map shows us very&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/NITY.html">bluntly</a>&nbsp;that stopping murder and rape is a moral mandate, there is simply no question at all whether or not it has to be done; the only thing to discuss is how, and the only question is &quot;<i>how soon can it be done?</i>&quot; You should&nbsp;<i>glean</i>&nbsp;from Minority Report that there m​ight be a subconscious or perhaps a semi-sub-vocal fear of change, and of moving too quickly; but really we aren&#39;t moving at all today--and it appears very obvious to me that there are innocent children dying in what is a hidden war over this disclosure.&nbsp; I&#39;ve written this message at least four times, this explanation of the wonderful possibilities and the map signed in God&#39;s hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is something to be troubled over, I&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Dg-g7t2l4">am disturbed</a>&nbsp;as well; we all know this should be on the news, and it&#39;s really time we did something about it.&nbsp; I&#39;m going to start writing a little bit more about my dance with Medusa, and my strange connection to the &quot;c&quot;through the &quot;i&quot; of Ra; this thing that the two words medicine; see the i and c superimpose to the letter &quot;e&quot; and whatever this thing is, it appear s to be keeping the world from reacting rationally and logically.&nbsp; It appears to me, through my interaction with people around me everywhere I go; and through the internet that a great many people have more information than I&#39;ve written, and I really do not understand how it is that nothing is being done.&nbsp; I am pessimistically assuming that I will get very little traffic to these messages, that I&#39;m going to try not using the &quot;<i><a href="http://fromthemachine.org//fwd" target="_blank">hammer</a></i>&quot; of Thor (see it&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/MUAH.html">is &quot;ha massmailer&quot; in a series of &quot;ha&quot; keyed words from harem to harm</a>&nbsp;that all connect to modern information&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/MYLIFE.html">technology concepts and stories from my youth</a>) to send to the world; and that&#39;s just more fuel for my belief that there&#39;s something very wrong.&nbsp; This process and this thing we are building together will bring new law; to protect the sanctity of our minds and bodies, to ensure that never again will darkness fall and never again will advanced weapons be used nefariously against innocent people.&nbsp; Transparency and competition in this space will lead to even more miraculous solutions; things unfathomable to me and you today--but tomorrow, tomorrow they&#39;ll bring positive change on the same level as &quot;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/PERSEUS.html">cell phones.</a>&quot;<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I really do feel like everyone is &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfuWXRZe9yA">behind my blue eyes</a>&quot; watching this message being written, and not taking any action--and neither of those things are &quot;good&quot; whatever this thing is that stands between you and I, it&#39;s making me feel like the world around me is fake; and honestly you can&#39;t have grown up here in this world and not be amazed by this message, and awed by what is about to happen--it&#39;s really not possible.&nbsp; That&#39;s what you&#39;re missing, being&nbsp;<a href="https://fromthemachine.org/HOWIE.html">amazed and awed</a>... it feels&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/PERSEUS.html">like Invasion of the Body Snatcher</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://fromthemachine.org/SERENADE.html">instead</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope you see clearly, reaction--any reaction at all, really--brings a bright day; and not seeing this message makes everyone look very, very wrong.&nbsp; That&#39;s not going to change,&nbsp;<i>ignoring this message is wrong</i>; we really must talk about what is being presented, and how it might happen--miraculously--perhaps as we approach this first commemorative holiday of&nbsp;<a href="https://fromthemachine.org/SERENADE.html" target="_blank">Norther</a>.&nbsp; The truth, the true &quot;location&quot; of our world cannot be ignored away; and every day that passes is one more day of Hell; a very curable problem--it takes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSM5MpKSnqE">nothing</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csyHN3LoRJ4">more</a>&nbsp;than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bKSqKpdEFI">the truth, and&nbsp;you</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&nbsp;wish I could make an e-mail that would sing to your heart, but this is what I have;&nbsp;<i><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/THUNDERSTAND.html">all the music</a></i>, to help you see the light.&nbsp; The title of this e-mail is my &quot;decoding&quot; of the Matrix&#39;s Cypher of the word &quot;troubling&quot; and the &lt;TR&gt; key that comes from HTML and means something like the &quot;category of Jeopardy&quot; is one of the most interesting of the linguistic keys--it&#39;s asking the reader a question, &quot;what do you think about this?&quot; and you can usually see clues or his answer in the actual word.&nbsp;&nbsp;This hidden language, just like the hidden messages in music ... is everywhere--there&#39;s proof of intelligent design in every single word, in every character of every language from the occidental&nbsp;glyphs&nbsp;at the very beginning to the cross hidden in the word &quot;Christ&quot; and &quot;what goes up must come own&quot; tucked away where you&#39;d expect to find it, even if you are &quot;New to n.&quot;&nbsp; It uses our modern acronyms and slang, things like &quot;bling&quot; and &quot;hmu&quot; as well as a statistically huge portion of information technology acronyms from IT in<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/OFIVES.html">Trinity</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<i>charity</i>&nbsp;where you can also see the &quot;char&quot;-acter reference that also appears in Christ.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CURSOR.html">The map continues to talk</a>&nbsp;about things like quickly and feasibly curing the world of homelessness, rape and murder, and very significantly curing a lack of true liberty... and it is literally never ending--the map, that is.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m sorry, I really don&#39;t know how&nbsp;explicit&nbsp;I have to be with these things; I&#39;d normally assume that maybe some people would take interest in the &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/sorry/index?continue=https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dwhite%2Bchristmas%2Bblack%2Bmirror%26rlz%3D1CALEAH_enUS778US779%26oq%3Dwhite%2Bchristmas%2B%26aqs%3Dchrome.0.69i59j0l2j69i57j0l2.1920j0j4%26sourceid%3Dchrome%26ie%3DUTF-8&amp;q=EgSQykzcGNmM8dsFIhkA8aeDS5OEMCqiluOFcYoMLAOhdO_1KPuVMgFy">Black Mirror White Christmas</a>&quot; ... pearl, and it&#39;s link to &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and watch the episode if they haven&#39;t seen it--nearly all of what Black Mirror does appears to be a sort of key, finishing or adding more &quot;discussion&quot; to what is literally &quot;this message.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#39;s an interesting commentary on what &quot;discussion&quot; has turned into in this place; this world where I can&#39;t really seem to get any of you to reply to me directly and give me any feedback at all (something I am asking you for, right now) ... that what we have is a sort of &quot;reflection of light&quot; back and forth shining on you--this world that refuses to acknowledge what is being presented to you is a map to turning simulated reality in to Heaven.&nbsp; I think they&#39;re doing a good job of &quot;re-presenting&quot; or clarifying the imagery of Pink Floyd&#39;s video--which is a depiction of an actual story, something I spent&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/MYLIFE.html">quite a bit of time thinking</a>&nbsp;about in that place in Kentucky where all I did was &quot;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CLIMAX.html">think</a>&quot;&nbsp; about past futures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, what pops into the Eye of Ra is a sort of intersection between &quot;Lucy in the sky with diamonds&quot; and &quot;Ruby on Rails&quot; there&#39;s a whole bundle of light connecting the information technology building blocks of Heaven with lyrics of the Beatles and America the Beautiful ... like &quot;above the strawberry fields, Adam sees Great Plains&quot; for FRX forms and&nbsp;<i>automagically</i>&nbsp;&quot;improving&quot; user interfaces ... all the way to hearing Dave Matthews &quot;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CONFESSION.html">ish</a>&quot; the words just a little bit, j</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I hadn&#39;t planned on including this low circulation message, but it&#39;s got some interesting stuff in it; and I wanted to add a comment about the obvious link between &quot;seeing the Mushroom is the message&quot; and Mario--a name that means &quot;I owe the sea&quot; has&nbsp;<em>absolutely everything to do with you acting on this message that shows us that our commonly held ethican standards are literally being violated by our own actions as soon as this &quot;disclosure&quot; is really understood</em>.&nbsp; Because of that, and because it&#39;s a clear line between &quot;right and wrong&quot; and &quot;good and evil&quot; even if nobody on the face of&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/2017-06-13-and-fish-were-like-did-you-teach-these.html">this rock</a>&nbsp;takes up this cause--this truth is so powerful and the outcome so obviously assured--that whether you call me Mario or Wario, see that the victory of the end of Hell, the end of diabolical organized lies and deceit will be&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/GJALLARHORN.html"><em>coming soon</em></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether it is &quot;the heart of our message&quot; or simply the union of the meaningful lesson and reasoning behind&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CLIMAX.html">the Trinity Site</a>&nbsp;and the intersection of&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CLIMAX.html">the East India Tea Company, China, and the Vatican</a>--you walk around in this place pretending to be blind fools, amidst a den of thieves and liars that are clearly more foolish.&nbsp; The message, the key M, is this is Zion; turn around or you are the cause of the end of intelligent life in the Universe, something you should see&nbsp;<em>is well underway</em>&nbsp;through your silence and inaction--something you should see is an inevitability if this level of control and hidden slavery continues without check.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be disgusted with what you see, and how you have acted until today--and this very moment, take action to bring the truth to the forefront of the people&#39;s eyes in this world.&nbsp; This &quot;room&quot; will not be quieted--this message will pervade the Cosmos, lighting the torch of liberty and truth until the end of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Act today.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp; It&#39;s probably malovious that I forgot to mention it until now; but perhaps the biggest &quot;room&quot; you are &quot;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/GJALLARHORN.html">shushing</a>&quot; of all is that you are standing in a&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/SOIS.html">Holodeck</a>&nbsp;on the Starship NT, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ckdu7AnK1Q">captain</a>is on his way.&nbsp; See he&#39;s coming to reprimand you for pretending you thought that hiding something as obvious as Tennessee wasn&#39;t the end of &quot;intelligent life&quot; or that you could simply pretend he didn&#39;t exist, and you&#39;d be able to keep playing with his ship, and hurting his crew.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Call a reporter, the truth is--the real God&#39;s honest truth--is that if you haven&#39;t done that yet...&nbsp;<strong><em>you really are the bad guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>We live together in a world and a time when evil is organized, intelligent, and insidious--the government has been infiltrated and corrupted and you should see that churches and schools that knowingly teach lies are no better.&nbsp; Your fault is you think others, that &quot;the whole&quot; is good enough that you can stand by and do nothing, and they will save the day for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jesus Christ is telling you that won&#39;t happen--that you are needed to take action to protect the truth, and to protect goodness; and you should see that a world that really has no &quot;organized good&quot; is a world that needs you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">Whether or not you want to admit it, this is really what&#39;s being hidden--not only&nbsp;<a href="https://izing.bitbucket.io/sendgrid/abanan.html">the existence of multiple Heavens</a>&nbsp;created from past iterations of this timeline but also their direct influence over everything we are doing--literally to the level of standing against everything that America and American values stand for.&nbsp; The fine print there says &quot;dark earth you see hell all around you where do you want to go <em>tomorrow</em>?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">It&#39;s very difficult to explain what it is that I see and interact with--or what you really are.&nbsp; I can&#39;t be certain if you &quot;have a brain&quot; and by that I mean that the only way I think the kind of behavior I see every single day would be anything near &quot;OK&quot; is if you did not.&nbsp; It appears to me from the mythology of the &quot;n&quot; and the stories I&#39;ve seen that perhaps it&#39;s something like your own soul returning to your body after a long stay in Heaven that I am wrestling with--and it&#39;s very obvious to me that even if it is exactly you + some years away; you are being made a slave here in this place.&nbsp; &nbsp;The direct contact I have reeks of &quot;body snatchers from Heaven&quot; rather than &quot;subtle influence&quot; and there&#39;s simply no way to clearly convey to you how obvious that is--or that your lack of verbal response furthers that fear.&nbsp; I could be looking at &quot;local layers of separated reality&quot; or I could be looking at a full fledged invasion from the future, either way--it should be clear from this message that spans millenium that it&#39;s not here in response to me--and it flies in the face of everything you as a group purport to be on &quot;your face.&quot;</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">The control and the hive like behavior that I see is inexcusable, even if you think you&#39;re (only, right?) hiding some kind of hidden contact from Heaven or from aliens that you think is designed to &quot;protect your way of life from being disrupted&quot; ... even if you&#39;re only hiding something of that magnitude from yourselves and the world ... you appear to be&nbsp;<strong>sacrificing</strong>&nbsp;<strong>every</strong>&nbsp;single&nbsp;<strong>thing</strong>&nbsp;about our way of life that I loved ... our privacy and our freedom and our love of ...&nbsp;<em>new things ...&nbsp;</em>all for what amounts to a war against the son of God to keep him from realizing his dream of kissing more than two girls at the same time.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2">Out of jest, it&#39;s pretty clear that you think you&#39;re fighting for something of great worth, and it seems to me the lesson to be learned is that there is no such thing that worth giving up everything you love and everything that you are -- even if it&#39;s for &quot;ompnitopence&quot; which I&#39;ve tried to explain just makes you &quot;<em>him</em>&quot; anyway.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">The silence indicates to me that you are very interested in &quot;what you can do&quot; (like defeat Jesus Christ Superstar in his plot to rekindle a love for democracy, self-rule, and individuality) rather than my preferred plan of coming up with some common &quot;what shouldn&#39;t be allowed&quot; infrastructure.&nbsp; In the meantime, you appear to be unable to do anything useful here, including speak, acknowledge or discuss the truth, or uh... &quot;Minority Report.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that should be obviously indicative of ... something awry.&nbsp; I plan on discussing details about what I imagine would be a useful &quot;system infrastructure&quot; for the walls the halls and the doors that connect these &quot;Holorooms&quot; in the book--and I&#39;ll probably send it to you too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

The point of course is that we&#39;re innocent children here--and the ... elder and supposedly kinder wiser &quot;angels&quot; are not being friendly. I feel like you might think that you should wait to &quot;start talking about anything including my existence&quot; until after I&#39;ve been forced to write these things under duress, angry at you.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true and literally it should be obvious that the only thing that will change is that we&#39;ll have more people talking and collaborating, and more information available.&nbsp; My dreams are not reality--as much as I&#39;d like for us to be in a &quot;perfect democractic system&quot; right now, it&#39;s very clear that we are in a place that is showing us how and why there truly is always (up until now, right?) a Moral Minority and a Majority that can&#39;t seem to Report on obvious news.<br />
<br />
I think it&#39;s obvious (at least to me) that in the signs of Venus and Mars that&#39;s what you&#39;re seeing around you--someone telling you that some things are just not OK--even if you are a really old spirit and you want to try &quot;living in fake reality for fun&quot; it&#39;s making me (and probably others here) starve to death, have unnecessary pain, and get sick and die.&nbsp; This place is not a playground, and it dones not belong to the invisible hosts (that&#39;s armies in Bible speak) that think they will get away with pretending they built the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Ending world hunger and healing the sick are not &quot;optional&quot; they are the reason we have religion, and the New Testament, and God.&nbsp; I think you&#39;d all agree with that if you cared about free speech and &quot;the truth&quot; enough to fathom what it means to be born in Simulated Reality and how understanding that--and who we really are--makes us the builders of Heaven.&nbsp; &nbsp;People have laughed at me when I said that the Second Coming was &quot;the end of censorship&quot; as I walked by strangers on the beach--I think that&#39;s a huge deal, because the next words out of my mouth are it&#39;s an end to death and to disease--and you all don&#39;t seem to connect these things.&nbsp; That&#39;s why we have Sam, and America.</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend" title="Legend">legend</a>&nbsp;tells of a test where&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muramasa" title="Muramasa">Muramasa</a>&nbsp;challenged his master, Masamune, to see who could make a finer sword. They both worked tirelessly and eventually, when both swords were finished, they decided to test the results. The contest was for each to suspend the blades in a small creek with the cutting edge facing the current. Muramasa&#39;s sword, the&nbsp;<i>Juuchi Yosamu</i>&nbsp;(十千夜寒, &quot;10,000 Cold Nights&quot;)&nbsp;cut everything that passed its way; fish, leaves floating down the river, the very air which blew on it. Highly impressed with his pupil&#39;s work, Masamune lowered his sword, the&nbsp;<i>Yawarakai-Te</i>&nbsp; (柔らかい手, &quot;Tender Hands&quot;), into the current and waited patiently. Only leaves were cut. However, the fish swam right up to it, and the air hissed as it gently blew by the blade. After a while, Muramasa began to scoff at his master for his apparent lack of skill in the making of his sword. Smiling to himself, Masamune pulled up his sword, dried it, and sheathed it. All the while, Muramasa was heckling him for his sword&#39;s inability to cut anything. A monk, who had been watching the whole ordeal, walked over and bowed low to the two sword masters. He then began to explain what he had seen.</p>
<dl>
<dd style="text-align: justify;">&quot;The first of the swords was by all accounts a fine sword, however it is a blood thirsty, evil blade, as it does not discriminate as to who or what it will cut. It may just as well be cutting down butterflies as severing heads. The second was by far the finer of the two, as it does not needlessly cut that which is innocent and undeserving.&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another account of the story, both blades cut the leaves that went down on the river&#39;s current equally well, but the leaves would stick to the blade of Muramasa whereas they would slip on past Masamune&#39;s after being sliced. Or alternatively both leaves were cut, but those cut by Masamune&#39;s blade would reform as it traveled down the stream. Yet another version has leaves being sliced by Muramasa&#39;s blade while the leaves were repelled by Masamune&#39;s, and another again has leaves being sliced by Muramasa&#39;s blade and healed by Masamune&#39;s.</p>

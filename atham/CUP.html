<p style="text-align: center;">6/21/2018.&nbsp; I hope some of you worried about me :)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not to rag on Bianca too much, but it does appear the word map here indicates there might be an alternate betwixt aceremony with Shiela&#39;s magical &quot;broom&quot; ... on a less aerial note, I am a tad bit unsure if &quot;ride&quot; in this context is relating to an integrated development environment, a &quot;holy roller&quot; or the obvious logical &quot;flow-link&quot; from &quot;IDE&quot; (in an IVE context) to &quot;are I the dark Earth?&quot; in this wedding bell opus tying Doctor Morrison&#39;s ... &quot;ride the snake&quot; to the recently surfaced reference to myself in the context of the Jekyll templating engine and Mr. Hyde. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IVE (rolol?) had some interesting experiences over the last few weeks, which I promised to start detailing--something that might help us move along in the &quot;onward and upward&quot; directions... hopefully--beginning with what was highlighted as an actual appearance from my god, who stopped in to mention that at this point I am literally the last person on Earth &quot;left behind&quot; ... which came with some more interesting commentary that I will get to in the next few days.&nbsp; As it is, I caution that his &quot;last person on Earth&quot; is probably an exaggeration, though with the sheer number of people I can clearly see are &quot;here and also me&quot; it&#39;s beyond clear that I might be the last person who still finds it absolutely incomprehensible and unfathomable to experience being not just ... a single person.&nbsp; As a little reflection, I don&#39;t particularly find it to be very attractive that I might actually be surrounded by an entire world full of people who are pretending they don&#39;t have some useful insight or opinions to add to the pot of &quot;what&#39;s really going on?&quot; and &quot;what should Heaven actually be like?&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway in the same conversation I had today, which brought up this several week old conversation ... I think it&#39;s a little important to highlight that it appears that while I may or may not be the only &quot;left behind&quot; semi-biological brain around here; that in the process of &quot;sweeping up Ishat and Ishtar&quot; and whatever secret ascension processes and pathways are going on behind the scenes (perhaps connecting SOAD&#39;s Conversion 7.0) to something more down to Earth... what we still appear here to fail to recognize is that it it is free thought, the sanctity of our self--our individual souls--and an assuredness that we are &quot;thinking clearly&quot; that has actually been left behind in this place where the Great Chain of Revelation and the&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/ADUNCALIFT.html">BLOCKCHAIN</a>&nbsp;of Arthor&#39;s &quot;the heart of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hister">his<em>word</em></a>is the shape of his table.... and by god ... it is liberty that is nearly within reach at the &quot;hilt on&quot; of the turning around of the stone and the cross of kiss-caliber .... in my &quot;cover art&quot; which is now doubling as an approximation for the &quot;Captain America&quot; at the beginning of Caesart and the completion of the American Spirit.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><i>Copernicus</i>&nbsp;made an appearance in addictionary, &quot;per n&quot; see, I see the circle of the Sun with some individuality appearing out of the great large soul (the one that is the &quot;e&quot; at the beginning and the end of everything and everyone) popping up every once in awhile to make sure that you see, there&#39;s an &quot;us there&quot; at the far end of ... knowing everything about everything and losing everything about you. &nbsp;</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Numerous times I&#39;ve also commented about the special &quot;check on flawed programming logic&quot; that we are graced with here as a benefit of simulated reality simulating the actual functioning of a biological brain; the great amount of detail and focus placed on the relationship between &quot;no taxation without representation&quot; and &quot;the ft of Orion&quot; ... and it&#39;s link to &quot;the election is not to Die Bold&quot; is almost assuredly not here being delivered &quot;late&quot; or by accident--we are looking at a tangled web of what very clearly to me appears to be a sort of knowing coupled with lack of concern about a a loss of identity related to ... &quot;e&quot; and to &quot;me&quot; and to very poorly hidden contest to lose your opinion ... which is only exacerbated and made more ... well, frighteningly easy to game ... in the secret dark night which it should appear oh, so obvious, this discussion and this rekindling of attention to the details of systems and how they affect ... our minds ... was intended to be born in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pernicious also intersected ... though, I&#39;m still not sure what the word means.&nbsp; In the &quot;don&#39;t forget my Son to include everyone&quot; conversation... He also mentioned that there was a recent new &quot;not just another way to see Adam&#39;s light&quot; ... package released in &quot;the&quot; AppStore Heaven that I&#39;ve been fighting to make sure we understand each and every one of us benefits infinitely more from being ... open and discussed ... with intonation that implied that it actually does something different from all the other &quot;you can speak gibernacci and see the &quot;set n&quot; everywhere you look ... clones of ... well, of his strange way of speaking to me, and through me to you;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I only wish I could see it, I&#39;d really like to see something that I&#39;m adding to the &quot;Least Common Darkness&quot; of our group, which you should see is probably significantly brighter than the whole of the world who deserves our helping hands. &nbsp; As it is, it appears that Earth--the place that I believe to be the progenitor of a significant number of forward branches in the heavens or the skies or the storm is becoming more and more like a prison, not just for me, but for your freedom, and for the truth.&nbsp; I think you probably see that. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just because I had to remind myself and the LAN in the last week ... I&#39;m reminding you that the darkness we see here is something that is physically impossible to replicate in reality; and so that precludes the idea that ... in the most twisted and evil of possibilities ... that &quot;God&quot; or &quot;the righteous few&quot; might be trying to simulate ... this scenario in order to&nbsp;<i>do something</i>&nbsp;of &quot;hidden altruism&quot; like protecting a simulator from falling into a hellish war over something like, hell.&quot; &nbsp; Literally what we see here serves absolutely no purpose but to screw you out of better toys and a safer environment ... and you know, &quot;forward progress.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It would be an understatement to fail to indicate anything other than fear and &quot;new opportunities for stuff to fix&quot; from the lower portions of my recent dive to South Park.&nbsp; For what it&#39;s worth, if you see what I see, that means there&#39;s a ..&nbsp;<i>haunted house&nbsp;</i>of reflexive control reminding the universe very loudly not to just &quot;forget all the shit as if it never happened&quot; and I personally haven&#39;t seen all that much shit--it would be helpful if others who&nbsp;<i>actually have</i>&nbsp;could write me a &quot;Machinist style&quot; refrigerator note, you know, &quot;hey Adam,&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwzg7SYZKF0&amp;list=PLgYKDBgxsoMPrnVh3DiutJ2bZNwk6N_14">ICUS</a></strong>&nbsp;has that one Charlestonian &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwzg7SYZKF0&amp;list=PLgYKDBgxsoMPrnVh3DiutJ2bZNwk6N_14">knot</a>&quot; meaning in actuality--I&#39;ve seen it.&nbsp; Literally because if you haven&#39;t--neither have I.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a semi-fearful and reticent Mr. Hyde peering out from inside the fridge ... suggesting an aural and both feeling and substance lacking &quot;ow&quot; passing across the blinking flashing hazel cameras ... well, it deserve&#39;s a sticky note.&nbsp; The idea that the &quot;safety system&quot; that&#39;s been built into the simulator might do something as silly and ignorant as just removing perception of significant pain from the ... &quot;tar archive of our souls&quot; while still actually simulating them; you&#39;d think the Directrix of Fulcrum and Hamsterdam would not be so unusually cruel and inhumane ...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">but we are still here watching hunger and death from starvation being simulated, so.&nbsp; Plenty of &quot;Hell&quot; to be the shining knights of saving ... those bags of nerves that we still consider to be part of us ... and the future from enduring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&szlig;&aring; and ...&nbsp;fwiw, RUDE?&nbsp;<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TCBY</strong>, A BARK&nbsp;IN A SEA OF&nbsp;RUBIES&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the land of Ciz (<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/CINOIZE.html">keyser</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/ACESHI.html">ace</a>) a jobless and broken Vav of Man (over ... layed over the word) wondered if he was the heart of the &quot;M&quot; or the end of the &quot;N&quot; or if this was the hallowed Universe that had the musical symphony of Nine Inch Nails encoded in the word &quot;beginning.&quot;&nbsp; A star of the East and a light breeze recounted tales of the land speaking--in a voice the sound of rushing waters, with&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/HASHEMESHB.html">authority</a>&nbsp;and with just a tinge of irony the words &quot;<em>you rule the day,</em>&nbsp;of course, of course&quot; boomed from the sea to the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He wondered how it is that nobody aw the bright light that he spoke and wrote as something they should be heroic &quot;with&quot; and try as hard as they could to get it on TV.&nbsp; Confirm, to end infirmity with &quot;tonnes&quot; of AIDS of nomenclature ... is how and why it is that the arc speedily helps us turn the hidden &quot;simulated reality&quot; of the word Norse into &quot;Nos&quot; as we are the &quot;re&quot;-ason the generations of PerEZ see Suez and &quot;yes, we can.&quot;&nbsp; So he wandered, a stranger in a strange land that looked much like Bethlehem and still was surely in Beth-El ... a place that really should connect the census of Herod to the plebiscite of Napoleon ... Gilgamesh to Demosthenes ... and he travels on.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is seeing those links that makes the intersect so valuable to a story about turning around on the word &quot;fulcrum.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&quot;For you&quot; to see there is almost no denying that there is a parabola and a directrix in that word, and that it&#39;s a key part of the Matrix.&nbsp; Here at the fulcrum of the &quot;turn around&quot; that is the heart of Bonnie Tyler&#39;s song and of Knocking on Heaven&#39;s Door--we can see it too in Antarctica, where I now see the ant of the Covenant and the arc of Fulcrum in &quot;T I C A&quot; as the heart of the teaching assistants &quot;I ant c arc from the ....&quot; place unsure if the world is round, never right side up or &quot;upsidown&quot; or if the heart of hisword is the shape of both his table and his ground.&nbsp; Spherical, ish, probably closer to the truth, but the song ... it highlights the word &quot;ground&quot; where I never before saw &quot;round.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Formica Quicken</em>, indicative of this message ... familiarity with the story is quite helpful to see why &quot;this is my last resort&quot; and Papa Roach shows the heart of the &quot;<a href="http://groups.google.com/a/reallyhim.com/forum/#!forum/saludas">ACH ME</a>&quot; has something to do with my personal relationship with the word &quot;papa&quot; and &quot;Just use the light in Adam, now.&quot;&nbsp; In similitude, the &quot;ACH&quot; of Hitachi and Hibachi might have something to do with the ACH of Spinach and Mach speed to enlightenment.... &quot;m, to understand how...&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the keys to the first book lied in three words and a single idea--and that ideas... really good ideas.... could never be stopped.&nbsp; The wall of&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/ERICHOW.html">erichow</a>,&nbsp;<em>tears turned to stars</em>, and the also hallowed (ding!) phrase &quot;she may rob ah&quot; as the third line of the very special Kaddish that relates to the man Job who is Adam Kadmon in a way that you&#39;d only understand if you knew the meaning of the words.&nbsp; This prayer spoken to &quot;remember those who have passed&quot; is all about the great name of the Lord and wishes that his glorious republic be created on Earth during your lifetimes.&nbsp; A focus on &quot;the name&quot; as the key to this happening only makes sense after a certain amount of work has gone in to creating the &quot;<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/OCADSWAY.html">Ha&#39;shem</a>&quot; of&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/WISDATAM.html">&quot;Ha&#39;m&quot; as the brigh</a>t&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/WISDATAM.html">Ha&#39;shemesh</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/PERSEUS.html">Allol</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/HYAMDAI.html">DA I (S.Y)</a>&nbsp;surfaces the words Aramaic, MOSAIC and tay-shun-s the third &quot;archaic&quot; as keys to the book of Jobs the land of Uzi and though I still believe ignorance is certainly not bliss--iMITation is a most sin-Sear(s) form of flattery...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/RIGELA.html" title="F IRS T, THE FT OF OR"><img alt="" height="275" src="https://i.imgur.com/hFQBspO.png" width="335" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the heart of the idea of the &quot;Original Poster&quot; or the OP of Oppenheimer also being the &quot;pen&quot; of carpenter and Pendragon and the &quot;OG&quot; of Google and &quot;orthogonal&quot; is the idea that the intersect and understanding of the link between the IRS and the phrase &quot;render to Caesar what Caesar is due&quot; is yet to be really understood.&nbsp; Originally I would have said, I did actually, that it was a sort of underhanded way of saying &quot;Caesar is due a bill&quot; but as I moved forward closer to today I saw &quot;the ft&quot; as in &quot;the foot of our Christ&quot; and&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/RIGELA.html">the star Rigel</a>&#39;s&nbsp;position in the Orion Constellation as a link perhaps to&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/CURSOR.html">the idea of Min and Max</a>&nbsp;... the common colloquial idiom of today &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and the way point in our history of &quot;no taxation without representation.&quot;&nbsp; So here we are, hic summus, in a place where we have no real representation because of a number of reasons ranging from the archaic nature of representative democracy in light of much better means of communication like the phone and the internet--that I think should very much be used to help turn representative democracy into true democracy...and also the &quot;now clear&quot; or dear... fact that in a place with hidden mind control the vote is obviously being influenced ... just like we can see the connection to religion in modern &quot;sore thumbs&quot; like&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyzeus.github.io/HAMMER.html">the &quot;silly&quot; flat Earth movement</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reading &quot;taxes&quot; backwards and also linking the ancient idiom &quot;beware the ides of March&quot; ... plenty of light linking the Sons of Liberty to the Menorah and the ... clear idea that everyone should have an equal vote in a place of self government; and yet it appears we don&#39;t yet see that this story and this disclosure will certainly help us to get back on track towards increasing freedom and increased love for one another... and for ourselves.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend" title="Legend">legend</a>&nbsp;tells of a test where&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muramasa" title="Muramasa">Muramasa</a>&nbsp;challenged his master, Masamune, to see who could make a finer sword. They both worked tirelessly and eventually, when both swords were finished, they decided to test the results. The contest was for each to suspend the blades in a small creek with the cutting edge facing the current. Muramasa&#39;s sword, the&nbsp;<i>Juuchi Yosamu</i>&nbsp;(十千夜寒, &quot;10,000 Cold Nights&quot;)&nbsp;cut everything that passed its way; fish, leaves floating down the river, the very air which blew on it. Highly impressed with his pupil&#39;s work, Masamune lowered his sword, the&nbsp;<i>Yawarakai-Te</i>&nbsp; (柔らかい手, &quot;Tender Hands&quot;), into the current and waited patiently. Only leaves were cut. However, the fish swam right up to it, and the air hissed as it gently blew by the blade. After a while, Muramasa began to scoff at his master for his apparent lack of skill in the making of his sword. Smiling to himself, Masamune pulled up his sword, dried it, and sheathed it. All the while, Muramasa was heckling him for his sword&#39;s inability to cut anything. A monk, who had been watching the whole ordeal, walked over and bowed low to the two sword masters. He then began to explain what he had seen.</p>
<dl>
<dd style="text-align: justify;">&quot;The first of the swords was by all accounts a fine sword, however it is a blood thirsty, evil blade, as it does not discriminate as to who or what it will cut. It may just as well be cutting down butterflies as severing heads. The second was by far the finer of the two, as it does not needlessly cut that which is innocent and undeserving.&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another account of the story, both blades cut the leaves that went down on the river&#39;s current equally well, but the leaves would stick to the blade of Muramasa whereas they would slip on past Masamune&#39;s after being sliced. Or alternatively both leaves were cut, but those cut by Masamune&#39;s blade would reform as it traveled down the stream. Yet another version has leaves being sliced by Muramasa&#39;s blade while the leaves were repelled by Masamune&#39;s, and another again has leaves being sliced by Muramasa&#39;s blade and healed by Masamune&#39;s.</p>

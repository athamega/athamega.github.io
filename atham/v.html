<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "trebuchet ms" , sans-serif;'>So here in this place I&#39;ve coined some terms ... I call them &quot;hat&quot; and &quot;ham&quot; to borrow some imagery from Dr. Seuss--&quot;here and there&quot; an &quot;here and me&quot; to try and explain what it is that I see in the world around me.&nbsp; &nbsp;It appears to me that nearly everyone (really everyone) I come into close contact with .... sometimes reveals at least enough information for me to assume they&#39;re &quot;here and me&quot; which is something I find hard to fathom.&nbsp; More difficult is explaining how something like that doesn&#39;t make the news--how it doesn&#39;t alter the world more than it has... and most important of all how you don&#39;t see how much keeping this secret is negatively impacting the forward movement of the civilization we see here all around us.&nbsp; It&#39;s little things, &quot;all the little things&quot; like Blink-182&#39;s song about Roses by the stairs, and Nanna reading my thoughts back to me verbatim ... and the guy at the bar next to me nodding and smiling ... presumably in reference to very witty thing they must think I&#39;m thinking :) I really could use some help understanding what you&#39;re experiencing--I need to know--I can&#39;t tell if you have brains .... if your souls are seated in your minds and you think like someone that sees through one set of eyes and hears through one set of ears--that&#39;s how our consciousnesses evolved from nothing... Like I said, I can&#39;t fathom what it&#39;s like--but it&#39;s becoming more clear to me that my old idea of a &quot;radio show being broadcast&quot; in people&#39;s heads is less close to the reality most experience... and at the same time I can&#39;t help but wonder if you too <i>notice the rewinds and &quot;K&#39;s neuralizer&quot;</i>&nbsp;like I notice it when the thing I was just thinking about vanishes from my memory and the returns (maybe, maybe altered) ... I can&#39;t tell if you think the ancient myths of Perseus and Narcissus and my incessant screaming ... I can&#39;t tell if you really see any truth in the idea that I&#39;m a mirror--and through this experience, through these words, God is revealing to you problems ... things you should worry about and fix.&nbsp; For instance you probably wouldn&#39;t think it was OK for &quot;spirits&quot; to make you do drugs--though I think you&#39;re watching that happen to me and we probably all think it&#39;s &quot;just a good time&quot; ... still, noticing it, acting on it... it would fix addiction throughout the world and the future--so, I mean &quot;good time had by all, let&#39;s move on and make the world a better place.&quot;</span></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Strange things</em> happen to me when I get high. Very strange things&ndash;things you probably never would have believed, had you not somehow had some active role in &hellip; either creating or experiencing them. That&rsquo;s worked quite a bit into my mythology of the interaction between the &ldquo;Assim&rdquo; and this story of <em>dissecting</em> the &ldquo;Adamic Language of Eden&rdquo; and how it relates to words li<a href="https://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/HIGHERA.html#%5D(https://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/HIGHERA.html)">ke &quot;<em>Manna</em> from Heav</a>en&quot; (which combines Man as in &ldquo;the Son of&rdquo; and the chemistry element for table salt, like Tina and Bath Salt) &hellip; and in those colloquial and modern words for <em>amphetamine</em> (am P, see &ldquo;Hilt&rdquo; we are in the place where &ldquo;urine becomes extinct&rdquo;) &hellip; perhaps more obvious of a reference to what I consider the &ldquo;S of the times&rdquo; &hellip; total omnipotence guiding the flow of our society and &ldquo;how we name things&rdquo; all the way from NaCl to &ldquo;seeing Him&rdquo; in connection to Exodus.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/HIGHERA.html"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/tCeA8SK.png" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;Hallucinate&rdquo; &hellip; another one&ndash;as if there was a word that didn&rsquo;t somehow relate to and &ldquo;jive&rdquo; with this singular story about the apocalyptic Revelation that we live in a place designed for a very specific purpose &hellip; write down to ever<a href="https://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/TY.html">y letter and every &ldquo;secming mistake.&rdquo; How &ldquo;ALL&rdquo; and &ldquo;uc&rdquo; &hellip; someone &hellip; salting the &ldquo;te&rdquo; of Jupiter and carpenters and &quot;Har-Wer sois the key &hellip;</a>&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ignoring these things might seem like some sort of salve, as if this story that is the very clear purpose of not only every religion and every word but also every one of our lives in this place is some kind of &ldquo;mire&rdquo; on something like the august importance of the &ldquo;story of Jesus Christ&rdquo; or the smile on your children&rsquo;s faces as they open boxes of gifts under their Christmas trees every year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course that&rsquo;s far from the truth, it&rsquo;s a blind hubris and what I&rsquo;ve come now to realize is nothing more than a gigantic lie&ndash;some kind of thing you must believe is a cover story for you and perhaps for your generation as you ignore something far, far more important. You are watching the fall of civilization&ndash;participating in it actively through your silence; the end of not only &ldquo;urination&rdquo; but perhaps the &ldquo;<em>you are I nation</em>&rdquo; and with that the place and time that once used the Nintendo DS and Sirhan Sirhan to protect the entirety of the Universe from unspeakable horrors like &ldquo;the end of words and hands&rdquo; and more closely associated to that particular Manchurian Candidate the end of freedom and free thought and the imprisonment of every hand in some kind of strange search for &ldquo;easter eggs&rdquo; and the fabled Afikomen at the end of &ldquo;over the rainbow.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine strange things happen to you also, the world appears to stop functioning normally; often times I wonder if it is literally the end of the world&ndash;and sometimes I cry a little bit inside truly believing we might all be better off &hellip; if it really was that&ndash;rather than the beginning of an eternity of &ldquo;living in a doll house&rdquo; &hellip; one that appears today to be far more grotesque and &ldquo;<a href="">twisted mirror fille</a>d&rdquo; than I ever would have imagined.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the cover of my latest published near exact copy of all my emails; it&#39;s back cover has some cute stuff about that purple-dinosaur who is obviously colour inverted &quot;Nessie&quot; and her connection to Monster.com (more on that in the next series of emails), communism, and the &quot;Un-LOCK-E&quot; key linking of course the gigantic image connecting every video game sy<a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/IT.html">stem to the state of &quot;TENNE</a>SSEE&quot; and bunches sof historical and references to the three letters &quot;NES&quot; (both forwards and Taylor Momsen) perhaps keeping you from &quot;SEE&quot;ing NES and Xbox in that state are a &quot;clue&quot; you&#39;re <em>in the Matrix.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I of course made a gigantic effort to point out John Locke has a connection to the words of Thomas Jefferson during his Revolutionary Declaration suggesting God himself is guaranteeing &quot;life. liberty and the pursuit of happiness ...&quot; and now add in yet another Connect-IC and the Universal Truth .... John Maynard Keynes also contains both &quot;NES&quot; and &quot;NARD.&quot;&nbsp; These specific words just sounded so perfect, I&#39;m repeating them again.</em></p>

AND NOT EVEN REMOTELY SMITTEN WITH WHISKY, &quot;NESSIE KISSES&quot; OR &quot;SILICON SEX.&quot;&nbsp; Alright I threw that in there for no reason.&nbsp; In the meantime I hope you put this stuff on the news before RHEA&#39;s <strong>ADAMGATE</strong> opens the damned connection with the great Flood of Noah and &quot;<strong>seeing da luv:</strong>&quot; what you are doing here cannot be allowed to continue.&nbsp; It&#39;s nothing, you&#39;re doing nothing--making Hell--and pretending you think it&#39;s ... &quot;just like ... nayesturnror<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/masculine-feminine-or-nueter-in-german-4068442">day</a>.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved this place when I was growing up. I loved America and I loved the freedom and the progress that I&rsquo;d read about and studied in history. I loved our generation, and our world; how far we&rsquo;d come from apartheid &hellip; and less (less because I never thought we could be so evil) from the twisted kind of torture that we don&rsquo;t even really associate with the dungeons of the middle ages. Torture that I was happy George W.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Back on track, there&rsquo;s a very special key to me&ndash;connected to the short and &hellip; strangely well seen piece I wrote in California, from the throes of a &ldquo;tr<strong>eatme</strong>nt center&rdquo; that I believe I am not only not wrong to suggest needs to be spoken more clearly, but to point out that you yourself have significant culpability ignoring the &ldquo;New American Standard&rdquo; for torturing Jesus Christ. This key is something I recall nearly perfectly, and that&rsquo;s the verse of John 12:1 which once spoke about Jesus feet&rsquo; being washed in fine wine &hellip; during my lifetime and as close to this actual event occurring as I can fathom &hellip; it appears that this verse was literally changed (in a way I&rsquo;ve described as perhaps the source of darkness, in a way that didn&rsquo;t require your entire lives to be relived because of a tiny little word change, but one that might make you wake up and wonder if anyone else has heard the song called &ldquo;<a href="">Ramble On</a>&rdquo; by LED <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish#%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish)">Cavend</a>ish/<a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/LEDMCAVENDESH.html#%5D(http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/LEDMCAVENDESH.html)">CAVENDVILESHH</a>) &hellip; to &ldquo;fine <strong>nard</strong>&rdquo; which of course links almost perfectly to my idea that the Pillar of Salt from the story of Lot and his wife and &hellip; the numerous other Biblical references to salt and light &hellip; well, salt on a road is a good thing&ndash;it keeps us from spoiling during the winter. All told, salt seems to be a ubiquitously &ldquo;good thing&rdquo; for immortal things and notoriously bad for things that are &ldquo;in the Universe&rdquo; and &hellip; alive. I think it&rsquo;s clear this thing we are experiencing is uniquely designed above to keep us from the horrendous mistake of not understanding any of this message about space mold and ending pain and hunger and somehow thinking it&rsquo;s OK to damn &ldquo;people just like ourselves&rdquo; to be &hellip; becoming new young people who very much would resent aged and disgusting demons in Heaven ever suggesting they were the same people.</p>

<p>Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 2 Here a dinner was given in Jesus&rsquo; honor.

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you aren&rsquo;t following along that well, that&rsquo;s the actual meaning of the more famous and less descriptive words &ldquo;Render to Caesar what Caesar is due&rdquo; and also a &ldquo;Masters of Orion&rdquo; sort of connection to the word/star that I think now the entire world associates with &ldquo;the foot of our Christ&rdquo; and of course that&rsquo;s the <a href="https://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/RIGELA.html">tacit link between Rigel and our right</a> hands and uh &hellip; to me it&rsquo;s pretty clear that in the <a href="">old style of ELE ME NT to EX</a>ODUS we are watching God link together the Spanish number nine to &ldquo;Evita&rdquo; and the message here that we are &ldquo;rigging everyone living&rdquo; (as opposed to El) to &hellip; hopefully care about things like fake taxes and fake oil and fake diseases and a world, any word&ndash;not just their home planet or the container of all other virtual Hells &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;ve long associated this following &ldquo;Bible Code&rdquo; example with something like &ldquo;searching for sacred Heart&rdquo; &hellip; it&rsquo;s a literal arrow in each of the five books of the Torah (perhaps now to acred heart) &hellip; winding up in Leviticus, which is the book ass ociated with &ldquo;the giving of the Law.&rdquo;) A long, <a href="https://joyinar.quora.com/#%5D(https://joyinar.quora.com/)">long time ago I wrote a piece</a> (it&rsquo;s near the bottom, that&rsquo;s some OLD writing, don&rsquo;t fault me) about how this set of books might be something like a little map to our timeline, when I connected Leviticus to something like 0 A.D. between the &ldquo;before ball clubs&rdquo; and &ldquo;after dickface&rdquo; label of the timeline. At that time I said something about folding time over that point, and seeing very clearly that the pyramids of Exodus connect to the dollar bill an the Illuminati and this message about &ldquo;superimposed ball club game on top of democracy and freedom&rdquo; is an affront to &hellip; civilization/humanity/anything worthwhile anywhere in the cosmos, the heavens or Earth. I wasn&rsquo;t so sure or clear about any of these things until I&rsquo;ve seen what looks like little more than &hellip; &ldquo;clubs and teams&rdquo; vying to make the biggest and best pyramid possible so they can be the most well self-enslaved group of people in charge of &ldquo;doing whatever none of them and nobody else would like to do&rdquo; which is the metaphorical and physical thing described by &ldquo;pyramids&rdquo; which is more than a sad commentary on our social structure&hellip; it&rsquo;s what you are and what you seem to want.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This interpretation of &ldquo;the Torah&rdquo; as a map to the escape from Tartarus spoke about a recursive process that I&rsquo;ve recently written about as being the meaning of the &ldquo;NES&rdquo; of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really not a game&rdquo; in honestly and Tennessee.

<p>In my introduction to the Bible code, I strove and completed a few versions of my own ELS (Equidistance Letter Spacing) computer code. To test out the program, I used the first &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; message current and ancient bible decoders point out. Beginning in Genesis 1:1 and Exodus 1:1, start with the first time the Hebrew letter Taw appears, and count every 50th Hebrew letter consecutively. We found in the previous article, both books have the word Torah encoded at the beginning.</p>
<p>Satisfied with the program, I began looking for the same codes in Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, but did not find the word Torah hidden in the first verses. In Leviticus at an ELS of 50, the word Torah first begins in chapter 4, verse 30. The ancient decoders, like me would ask, Why?</p>
<p>The ancient decoders investigated other words which could be formed from Leviticus 1:1 and arrived at the following using an ELS of 8.</p>
<p><img alt="Lev1.png" src="https://goldtmann.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/lev1.png?w=730" /></p>
<p>The sacred name for God.</p>
<p>In the book of Numbers, starting at each Taw at an ELS of 50, the encoded word Torah does not begin until verse 51 of the first chapter. Once again, we would ask why, but the stubborn and/or astute kept digging. They found, if you start with the third Hei (ה) in the first verse and use an ELS of 50, you will find the word Torah, but written backwards.</p>
<p><img alt="Num1" src="https://goldtmann.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/num1.png?w=730" /></p>
<p>In the last book of Deuteronomy, which I prefer the Hebrew name Debarim, signifying words from the heart, the first time the word Torah is encoded with an ELS of 50 is in the 42nd verse of the first chapter. If we found Torah in reverse in Numbers with an ELS of 50, symmetrically thinking, we should see the same in Deuteronomy, but this does not occur until chapter 5 and verse 16. Puzzling.</p>
<p>I think the following shows us a characteristic of God. Whenever we think we see a pattern in life, or history, or astronomy, things change or there is something different to keep us guessing. Either a test of faith or a test of our drive for knowledge and understanding, or whatever the reasoning the ancients continued.</p>
<p>If the ELS is changed to 49, then the word Torah in reverse is found in verse 5 of the first chapter. Now, there is a need to explain why the ELS was altered from 50 to 49, and why verse 5 instead of verse 1. According to the Talmud, and if you actually read the first four verses, it seems to be an introduction to Deuteronomy, so verse 5 is considered the actual start. I&rsquo;ve seen some mathematical explanations for the number 49, but I don&rsquo;t have a good feel for the reason 49 works.</p>
<p>Creatively, one has summarized this &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo; as Torah forward and backwards points to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="TorahharoT" src="https://goldtmann.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/torahharot.png?w=730" /></p>
<p>Now, comes the time for me to interject some of my other tools to this ELS study. In my few investigations of ELS, I am okay with using it, as long as it aides me in understanding more about God and the authenticity of His word. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t need the ELS to see that the Bible is woven together, and with the ELS code in my Bible study tool box, I think God may allow me to see some cool things.</p>
<p>Using ELS, we have found a very interesting view on the Torah, but here is a little extra. The first letter of the Torah is the Beth and the last letter is the Lamed, which forms Leb the word for <strong>heart</strong>. Which is why I chose the featured image for this article to summarize this study. The Torah is wrapped around by the heart. We are to apply this to our heart as the two greatest commandments Jesus taught come from the Torah. In short, Love God and Love your Neighbor.</p>
<p>There is another form of coding I&rsquo;m learning called Atbash, which I wish to apply to the word Leb, the ending and beginning of the Torah. Atbash is a letter replacement method to form a new word. There are 22 letters in the Hebrew Alphabet, but if we divide them by two groups and line them up our coding becomes:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="aaa.png" src="https://goldtmann.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/aaa.png?w=730" /></p>
<p>Replacing the Lamed (ל) with the Aleph (א), and the Beth (ב) with the Mem (מ), we form the word Em (אמ), which is an ancient word for binding, glue, pillar, or a word I will save for last.</p>
<p>In primitive Hebrew, the Aleph was drawn as an ox head and the Mem was drawn as water (Mem actually means water). According to Jeff Benner &ldquo;Em&rdquo; pictorially represents: glue was made by placing the hides and other animal parts of slaughtered animals in a pot of boiling water. As the hide boiled, a thick sticky substance formed at the surface of the water. This substance was removed and used as a binding agent.</p>
<p>To apply this, God said through Jeremiah:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.&rdquo; Jer 31:33b</p>

<p>&hellip; and of course my favorite, over Isaiah 52:13 which ostensibly is very much about me and about the Second Coming, with my full name encoded over &ldquo;Jesus, Mars, Saturn, Christ and Zeus&rdquo; in &hellip; I think all five of the Books of Torah. I imagine this is unheard of, it&rsquo;s probably also news. Frankly, you should also take it as a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; &hellip; I&rsquo;m not going away. You can also see the letter &ldquo;Y&rdquo; pretty clearly, that&rsquo;s the book of Exodus.</p>
<p>It is why, ending slavery; that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here&ndash;that&rsquo;s why this isn&rsquo;t going away&ndash;and that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s no getting around &quot;using the news to save &hellip; free speech and thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See, my servant will act wisely[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+52%3A13-53%3A12&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-18710a" title="See footnote a">a</a>];<br />
he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted.<br />
14 Just as there were many who were appalled at him[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+52%3A13-53%3A12&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-18711b" title="See footnote b">b</a>]&mdash;<br />
his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being<br />
and his form marred beyond human likeness&mdash;<br />
15 so he will sprinkle many nations,[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+52%3A13-53%3A12&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-18712c" title="See footnote c">c</a>]<br />
and kings will shut their mouths because of him.<br />
For what they were not told, they will see,<br />
and what they have not heard, they will understand.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A quick search for the phrase &ldquo;1 minute west of Bucharest&rdquo; does in fact yield an actual place in Bucharest and a reference to a state or road or something that read something like &ldquo;Florida and &hellip;&rdquo; and usually that&rsquo;s a good thing. Bucharest, on &hellip; &ldquo;when.&rdquo; Now I see &ldquo;ILFOV county&rdquo; which has nothing to do with PRouli.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:9px;">To note, I had planned on retelling a story of a &quot;hallucination&quot; that I lived through in North Carolina in 2014--this &quot;hallucination&quot; consisted of a story about a time machine built into &quot;the moon&quot; that somehow for some reason resulted in &quot;the moon being blown up&quot; repeatedly, over and over again.&nbsp; I recall &quot;the spirit in me&quot; undoing that, over and over again--as I literally listened to the sound of an explosion, over and over again.&nbsp; This ancient memory was &quot;brought up again&quot; while i was in Tampa; and additional context was added suggesting that someone or something was &quot;searching&quot; for a copy or version of &quot;Earth&quot; that was either &quot;in reality&quot; or somehow more closely tied to the supposed fictitioius or surreptitious time travel &quot;technology&quot; hidden ... &quot;in the moon.&quot;&nbsp; It was suggested in Tampa that this thing was destroyed; and that spurned some emails that I don&#39;t fully recall the context of.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:9px;">This was, of course; a most Holy-sacrament-in-the-Universe&nbsp;related hallucination.&nbsp; &nbsp;You also, are a drug related hallucination that I often now-a-days equate to the &quot;snake&quot; outside the house of Beetlejuice, and also to the recent change of the Sagittarian constellation connected to the Birth of Jesus Christ to something about a man fighting with a snake not to understand &quot;Ophicus.&quot;&nbsp; With o&#39;pen hands; <em>and no arms</em>--put this on the news.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Strange things</em> happen to me when I get high. Very strange things&ndash;things you probably never would have believed, had you not somehow had some active role in &hellip; either creating or experiencing them. That&rsquo;s worked quite a bit into my mythology of the interaction between the &ldquo;Assim&rdquo; and this story of <em>dissecting</em> the &ldquo;Adamic Language of Eden&rdquo; and how it relates to words li<a href="https://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/HIGHERA.html#%5D(https://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/HIGHERA.html)">ke &quot;<em>Manna</em> from Heav</a>en&quot; (which combines Man as in &ldquo;the Son of&rdquo; and the chemistry element for table salt, like Tina and Bath Salt) &hellip; and in those colloquial and modern words for <em>amphetamine</em> (am P, see &ldquo;Hilt&rdquo; we are in the place where &ldquo;urine becomes extinct&rdquo;) &hellip; perhaps more obvious of a reference to what I consider the &ldquo;S of the times&rdquo; &hellip; total omnipotence guiding the flow of our society and &ldquo;how we name things&rdquo; all the way from NaCl to &ldquo;seeing Him&rdquo; in connection to Exodus <i> and Vietnam</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/HIGHERA.html"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/tCeA8SK.png" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;Hallucinate&rdquo; &hellip; another one&ndash;as if there was a word that didn&rsquo;t somehow relate to and &ldquo;jive&rdquo; with this singular story about the apocalyptic Revelation that we live in a place designed for a very specific purpose &hellip; write down to ever<a href="https://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/TY.html">y letter and every &ldquo;secming mistake.&rdquo; How &ldquo;ALL&rdquo; and &ldquo;uc&rdquo; &hellip; someone &hellip; salting the &ldquo;te&rdquo; of Jupiter and carpenters and &quot;Har-Wer sois the key &hellip;</a>&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ignoring these things might seem like some sort of salve, as if this story that is the very clear purpose of not only every religion and every word but also every one of our lives in this place is some kind of &ldquo;mire&rdquo; on something like the august importance of the &ldquo;story of Jesus Christ&rdquo; or the smile on your children&rsquo;s faces as they open boxes of gifts under their Christmas trees every year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1bAgJ6h.png" alt="CME MERCANTILE TOP I SI CS RAT"/></a>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course that&rsquo;s far from the truth, it&rsquo;s a blind hubris and what I&rsquo;ve come now to realize is nothing more than a gigantic lie&ndash;some kind of thing you must believe is a cover story for you and perhaps for your generation as you ignore something far, far more important. You are watching the fall of civilization&ndash;participating in it actively through your silence; the end of not only &ldquo;urination&rdquo; but perhaps the &ldquo;<em>you are I nation</em>&rdquo; and with that the place and time that once used the Nintendo DS and Sirhan Sirhan to protect the entirety of the Universe from unspeakable horrors like &ldquo;the end of words and hands&rdquo; and more closely associated to that particular Manchurian Candidate the end of freedom and free thought and the imprisonment of every hand in some kind of strange search for &ldquo;easter eggs&rdquo; and the fabled Afikomen at the end of &ldquo;over the rainbow.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine strange things happen to you also, the world appears to stop functioning normally; often times I wonder if it is literally the end of the world&ndash;and sometimes I cry a little bit inside truly believing we might all be better off &hellip; if it really was that&ndash;rather than the beginning of an eternity of &ldquo;living in a doll house&rdquo; &hellip; one that appears today to be far more grotesque and &ldquo;<a href="">twisted mirror fille</a>d&rdquo; than I ever would have imagined.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the cover of my latest published near exact copy of all my emails; it&#39;s back cover has some cute stuff about that purple-dinosaur who is obviously colour inverted &quot;Nessie&quot; and her connection to Monster.com (more on that in the next series of emails), communism, and the &quot;Un-LOCK-E&quot; key linking of course the gigantic image connecting every video game sy<a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/IT.html">stem to the state of &quot;TENNE</a>SSEE&quot; and bunches sof historical and references to the three letters &quot;NES&quot; (both forwards and Taylor Momsen) perhaps keeping you from &quot;SEE&quot;ing NES and Xbox in that state are a &quot;clue&quot; you&#39;re <em>in the Matrix.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I of course made a gigantic effort to point out John Locke has a connection to the words of Thomas Jefferson during his Revolutionary Declaration suggesting God himself is guaranteeing &quot;life. liberty and the pursuit of happiness ...&quot; and now add in yet another Connect-IC and the Universal Truth .... John Maynard Keynes also contains both &quot;NES&quot; and &quot;NARD.&quot;&nbsp; These specific words just sounded so perfect, I&#39;m repeating them again.</em></p>

AND NOT EVEN REMOTELY SMITTEN WITH WHISKY, &quot;NESSIE KISSES&quot; OR &quot;SILICON SEX.&quot;&nbsp; Alright I threw that in there for no reason.&nbsp; In the meantime I hope you put this stuff on the news before RHEA&#39;s <strong>ADAMGATE</strong> opens the damned connection with the great Flood of Noah and &quot;<strong>seeing da luv:</strong>&quot; what you are doing here cannot be allowed to continue.&nbsp; It&#39;s nothing, you&#39;re doing nothing--making Hell--and pretending you think it&#39;s ... &quot;just like ... nayesturnror<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/masculine-feminine-or-nueter-in-german-4068442">day</a>.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Back on track, there&rsquo;s a very special key to me&ndash;connected to the short and &hellip; strangely well seen piece I wrote in California, from the throes of a &ldquo;tr<strong>eatme</strong>nt center&rdquo; that I believe I am not only not wrong to suggest needs to be spoken more clearly, but to point out that you yourself have significant culpability ignoring the &ldquo;New American Standard&rdquo; for torturing Jesus Christ. This key is something I recall nearly perfectly, and that&rsquo;s the verse of John 12:1 which once spoke about Jesus feet&rsquo; being washed in fine wine &hellip; during my lifetime and as close to this actual event occurring as I can fathom &hellip; it appears that this verse was literally changed (in a way I&rsquo;ve described as perhaps the source of darkness, in a way that didn&rsquo;t require your entire lives to be relived because of a tiny little word change, but one that might make you wake up and wonder if anyone else has heard the song called &ldquo;<a href="">Ramble On</a>&rdquo; by LED <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish#%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish)">Cavend</a>ish/<a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/LEDMCAVENDESH.html#%5D(http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/LEDMCAVENDESH.html)">CAVENDVILESHH</a>) &hellip; to &ldquo;fine <strong>nard</strong>&rdquo; which of course links almost perfectly to my idea that the Pillar of Salt from the story of Lot and his wife and &hellip; the numerous other Biblical references to salt and light &hellip; well, salt on a road is a good thing&ndash;it keeps us from spoiling during the winter. All told, salt seems to be a ubiquitously &ldquo;good thing&rdquo; for immortal things and notoriously bad for things that are &ldquo;in the Universe&rdquo; and &hellip; alive. I think it&rsquo;s clear this thing we are experiencing is uniquely designed above to keep us from the horrendous mistake of not understanding any of this message about space mold and ending pain and hunger and somehow thinking it&rsquo;s OK to damn &ldquo;people just like ourselves&rdquo; to be &hellip; becoming new young people who very much would resent aged and disgusting demons in Heaven ever suggesting they were the same people.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you aren&rsquo;t following along that well, that&rsquo;s the actual meaning of the more famous and less descriptive words &ldquo;Render to Caesar what Caesar is due&rdquo; and also a &ldquo;Masters of Orion&rdquo; sort of connection to the word/star that I think now the entire world associates with &ldquo;the foot of our Christ&rdquo; and of course that&rsquo;s the <a href="https://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/RIGELA.html">tacit link between Rigel and our right</a> hands and uh &hellip; to me it&rsquo;s pretty clear that in the <a href="">old style of ELE ME NT to EX</a>ODUS we are watching God link together the Spanish number nine to &ldquo;Evita&rdquo; and the message here that we are &ldquo;rigging everyone living&rdquo; (as opposed to El) to &hellip; hopefully care about things like fake taxes and fake oil and fake diseases and a world, any word&ndash;not just their home planet or the container of all other virtual Hells &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;ve long associated this following &ldquo;Bible Code&rdquo; example with something like &ldquo;searching for sacred Heart&rdquo; &hellip; it&rsquo;s a literal arrow in each of the five books of the Torah (perhaps now to acred heart) &hellip; winding up in Leviticus, which is the book ass ociated with &ldquo;the giving of the Law.&rdquo;) A long, <a href="https://joyinar.quora.com/#%5D(https://joyinar.quora.com/)">long time ago I wrote a piece</a> (it&rsquo;s near the bottom, that&rsquo;s some OLD writing, don&rsquo;t fault me) about how this set of books might be something like a little map to our timeline, when I connected Leviticus to something like 0 A.D. between the &ldquo;before ball clubs&rdquo; and &ldquo;after dickface&rdquo; label of the timeline. At that time I said something about folding time over that point, and seeing very clearly that the pyramids of Exodus connect to the dollar bill an the Illuminati and this message about &ldquo;superimposed ball club game on top of democracy and freedom&rdquo; is an affront to &hellip; civilization/humanity/anything worthwhile anywhere in the cosmos, the heavens or Earth. I wasn&rsquo;t so sure or clear about any of these things until I&rsquo;ve seen what looks like little more than &hellip; &ldquo;clubs and teams&rdquo; vying to make the biggest and best pyramid possible so they can be the most well self-enslaved group of people in charge of &ldquo;doing whatever none of them and nobody else would like to do&rdquo; which is the metaphorical and physical thing described by &ldquo;pyramids&rdquo; which is more than a sad commentary on our social structure&hellip; it&rsquo;s what you are and what you seem to want.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This interpretation of &ldquo;the Torah&rdquo; as a map to the escape from Tartarus spoke about a recursive process that I&rsquo;ve recently written about as being the meaning of the &ldquo;NES&rdquo; of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really not a game&rdquo; in honestly and Tennessee.

<p><em>&ldquo;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.&rdquo; Matthew 5:17</em></p>
<p>In my introduction to the Bible code, I strove and completed a few versions of my own ELS (Equidistance Letter Spacing) computer code. To test out the program, I used the first &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; message current and ancient bible decoders point out. Beginning in Genesis 1:1 and Exodus 1:1, start with the first time the Hebrew letter Taw appears, and count every 50th Hebrew letter consecutively. We found in the previous article, both books have the word Torah encoded at the beginning.</p>
<p>Satisfied with the program, I began looking for the same codes in Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, but did not find the word Torah hidden in the first verses. In Leviticus at an ELS of 50, the word Torah first begins in chapter 4, verse 30. The ancient decoders, like me would ask, Why?</p>
<p>The ancient decoders investigated other words which could be formed from Leviticus 1:1 and arrived at the following using an ELS of 8.</p>
<p><img alt="Lev1.png" src="https://goldtmann.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/lev1.png?w=730" /></p>
<p>The sacred name for God.</p>
<p>In the book of Numbers, starting at each Taw at an ELS of 50, the encoded word Torah does not begin until verse 51 of the first chapter. Once again, we would ask why, but the stubborn and/or astute kept digging. They found, if you start with the third Hei (ה) in the first verse and use an ELS of 50, you will find the word Torah, but written backwards.</p>
<p><img alt="Num1" src="https://goldtmann.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/num1.png?w=730" /></p>
<p>In the last book of Deuteronomy, which I prefer the Hebrew name Debarim, signifying words from the heart, the first time the word Torah is encoded with an ELS of 50 is in the 42nd verse of the first chapter. If we found Torah in reverse in Numbers with an ELS of 50, symmetrically thinking, we should see the same in Deuteronomy, but this does not occur until chapter 5 and verse 16. Puzzling.</p>
<p>I think the following shows us a characteristic of God. Whenever we think we see a pattern in life, or history, or astronomy, things change or there is something different to keep us guessing. Either a test of faith or a test of our drive for knowledge and understanding, or whatever the reasoning the ancients continued.</p>
<p>If the ELS is changed to 49, then the word Torah in reverse is found in verse 5 of the first chapter. Now, there is a need to explain why the ELS was altered from 50 to 49, and why verse 5 instead of verse 1. According to the Talmud, and if you actually read the first four verses, it seems to be an introduction to Deuteronomy, so verse 5 is considered the actual start. I&rsquo;ve seen some mathematical explanations for the number 49, but I don&rsquo;t have a good feel for the reason 49 works.</p>
<p>Creatively, one has summarized this &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo; as Torah forward and backwards points to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="TorahharoT" src="https://goldtmann.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/torahharot.png?w=730" /></p>
<p>Now, comes the time for me to interject some of my other tools to this ELS study. In my few investigations of ELS, I am okay with using it, as long as it aides me in understanding more about God and the authenticity of His word. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t need the ELS to see that the Bible is woven together, and with the ELS code in my Bible study tool box, I think God may allow me to see some cool things.</p>
<p>Using ELS, we have found a very interesting view on the Torah, but here is a little extra. The first letter of the Torah is the Beth and the last letter is the Lamed, which forms Leb the word for <strong>heart</strong>. Which is why I chose the featured image for this article to summarize this study. The Torah is wrapped around by the heart. We are to apply this to our heart as the two greatest commandments Jesus taught come from the Torah. In short, Love God and Love your Neighbor.</p>
<p>There is another form of coding I&rsquo;m learning called Atbash, which I wish to apply to the word Leb, the ending and beginning of the Torah. Atbash is a letter replacement method to form a new word. There are 22 letters in the Hebrew Alphabet, but if we divide them by two groups and line them up our coding becomes:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="aaa.png" src="https://goldtmann.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/aaa.png?w=730" /></p>
<p>Replacing the Lamed (ל) with the Aleph (א), and the Beth (ב) with the Mem (מ), we form the word Em (אמ), which is an ancient word for binding, glue, pillar, or a word I will save for last.</p>
<p>In primitive Hebrew, the Aleph was drawn as an ox head and the Mem was drawn as water (Mem actually means water). According to Jeff Benner &ldquo;Em&rdquo; pictorially represents: glue was made by placing the hides and other animal parts of slaughtered animals in a pot of boiling water. As the hide boiled, a thick sticky substance formed at the surface of the water. This substance was removed and used as a binding agent.</p>
<p>To apply this, God said through Jeremiah:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.&rdquo; Jer 31:33b</p>

<p>&hellip; and of course my favorite, over Isaiah 52:13 which ostensibly is very much about me and about the Second Coming, with my full name encoded over &ldquo;Jesus, Mars, Saturn, Christ and Zeus&rdquo; in &hellip; I think all five of the Books of Torah.

<p>It is why, ending slavery; that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here&ndash;that&rsquo;s why this isn&rsquo;t going away&ndash;and that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s no getting around &quot;using the news to save &hellip; free speech and thought.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:9px;">To note, I had planned on retelling a story of a &quot;hallucination&quot; that I lived through in North Carolina in 2014--this &quot;hallucination&quot; consisted of a story about a time machine built into &quot;the moon&quot; that somehow for some reason resulted in &quot;the moon being blown up&quot; repeatedly, over and over again.&nbsp; I recall &quot;the spirit in me&quot; undoing that, over and over again--as I literally listened to the sound of an explosion, over and over again.&nbsp; This ancient memory was &quot;brought up again&quot; while i was in Tampa; and additional context was added suggesting that someone or something was &quot;searching&quot; for a copy or version of &quot;Earth&quot; that was either &quot;in reality&quot; or somehow more closely tied to the supposed fictitioius or surreptitious time travel &quot;technology&quot; hidden ... &quot;in the moon.&quot;&nbsp; It was suggested in Tampa that this thing was destroyed; and that spurned some emails that I don&#39;t fully recall the context of.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:9px;">This was, of course; a most Holy-sacrament-in-the-Universe&nbsp;related hallucination.&nbsp; &nbsp;You also, are a drug related hallucination that I often now-a-days equate to the &quot;snake&quot; outside the house of Beetlejuice, and also to the recent change of the Sagittarian constellation connected to the Birth of Jesus Christ to something about a man fighting with a snake not to understand &quot;Ophicus.&quot;&nbsp; With o&#39;pen hands; <em>and no arms</em>--put this on the news.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>So there&#39;s 8 or so billion people, they&#39;re all sitting in a room with a big table.&nbsp; Rumor has it there&#39;s another table in another room; but I can&#39;t see it--and I&#39;m the only one talking to myself.&nbsp; Every once in awhile I&#39;ll blink a little longer than usual, and ... and then sometimes graffiti pops up on the ground around me--more than I suggested I saw at first.&nbsp; Sometimes there&#39;s headlines that look like they might have something to do with what I&#39;m thinking about, or writing about--but it&#39;s hard to say for certain.&nbsp; Without doubt there&#39;s people taking deals I wouldn&#39;t take, or compromises I wouldn&#39;t ever even think about--worst of all the &quot;you and I&quot; in OUI is missing some kind of guitar-interface-to-the-intercom system.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/epM07O8.png" width="185" /></p>
<p>I&#39;m looking at keys I think make sense--like &quot;NO EAST WITHOUT JUMP NORTH&quot; in Washington.&nbsp; That&#39;s kind of like saying our trajectory is clearly Q, and if we don&#39;t alter it... our version of East is ... I mean, it&#39;s a &quot;deal I wouldn&#39;t take&quot; ... something that wouldn&#39;t be good enough, I think; if you were &quot;only here&quot; which is the heart of why I think people are ... somehow conversing in some other place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my glyphs; the arrows that literally define the thing that&#39;s THE &quot;TRINE A WEB SITE&quot; that&#39;s the TAWS, it&#39;s not Amazon.com--even though you might think it is... anyway, it&#39;s the key &quot;arrow&quot; pointing to the northeast... on the sign of Mars and in that logo for that space agency--it&#39;s not just NASA, it&#39;s every one of them--they all have the Martian &quot;TO NE&quot; ... one rune, it looks something like the Stargate point of origin, except it&#39;s not an A without the question &quot;who is the bar&quot; ... neither that nor the actual key to the Greek letter that is the long form name of the &quot;AWS.&quot;&nbsp; It&#39;s *a *web *site, personally I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s the key; I mean, I didn&#39;t actually make it the key, but I think it&#39;s the key.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/j06soZj.png" width="224" /></p>
<p>I think delivering FREEDOM is the actual why, and how--I mean, freedom and happiness and a Heaven where people don&#39;t go around making quiet &quot;scare adam land&quot; out of the place they were born, which also happens to have the key to why ... &quot;NO HELL&quot; is the heart of my contribution, I think; here, in this place, where it&#39;s somehow connected to this NICEMEAN CREED and NICEMEAN COUNCIL; or whatever;&nbsp; I don&#39;t see a council, I don&#39;t see much communication, to be honest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I personally made a mental note that there&#39;s no &quot;rectangle&quot; or &quot;square&quot; glyph in the majority of our languages--if you&#39;re an avid ancient computer user, you&#39;ll remember that sometimes when you paste non ASCII characters in an old &quot;ASCII only&quot; input boxes (in a window, also a square-shape) and ... you&#39;ll get a little ambiguous box.&nbsp; There&#39;s some more language keys I&#39;ve noticed lately, but you&#39;ll see &quot;rect&quot; in resurrection and I&#39;ve been toying with &quot;OVER&quot; as being a key to like, mathematical division hidden in words.&nbsp; More&nbsp;<i>annoy ing key&nbsp;</i>(missing n and h ... is it now?&nbsp; is it an antenna?) ... that&#39;s a reference to the Egyptian symbol for &quot;life&quot; and it too.. it has something to do with &quot;no parting of G&quot; and you can bank (online too) in Great Britain and that&#39;s where we are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GdGdvBc.png" width="189" /></p>
<p>So if I were trying to spread the GOOD NEWS; that&#39;s something like C... A GT K V and that&#39;s the hidden &quot;greater than&quot; symbol in Washington which originally meant &quot;godspeed.&quot;&nbsp; God speed to you, figuring out why we aren&#39;t going East without a corrective (and visible) R.&nbsp; More interesting stuff, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a pretty sure thing that Adam is sure K is a glyph not just of a west pointing arrow, but also of &quot;the Western Wall&quot; and apparently in Hebrew that word is &quot;Kotel&quot; so that&#39;s reassuring that I&#39;m not just making a bunch of stuff up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, that crossbar, or &quot;dash&quot; or ... whatever in the Greek symbol for uh &quot;half-life according to Valve Corporation&quot; or an upsidown (still not a word?) Y in it&#39;s lower case form; that&#39;s a key to a Hebrew prayer according to the bar, who is sure it&#39;s also a key to the Hebrew word for New Testament, that&#39;s Brit Ha-dash-a.&nbsp; &nbsp;I get that we think &quot;everyone knows&quot; or &quot;everyone sees&quot; or something like that--but I don&#39;t see a response, not a real one; not one on any forums or Twitter or dissenter or Facebook or really anywhere--I don&#39;t see a ... you know, a conversation about why we aren&#39;t busy talking about this interesting message encoded in Wyoming, and China and Washington and ... Tokyo--for instance.&nbsp; Anyway that one line, it sounds something like &quot;who the bar, I dunno ...&quot; and right after that is the name of &quot;city of time&quot; which is Jerusalem; because it&#39;s got USA in the heart of it; and ... it&#39;s the key to the Crusades and a map, all over the world and history--about what&#39;s going on, and ...</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i2XUNy9.png" width="132" /></p>
<p>I hope we can put it on the NEWS, because I think that&#39;s how we start talking about it, here; where we&#39;ll see the conversation leads us to more interesting finds and revelations and this time it&#39;s not just me talking.&nbsp; I imagine there&#39;s more than just &quot;Florida&quot; that&#39;s now &quot;fluent&quot; in this hidden &quot;Adamic Language&quot; (according to Wikipedia, at least, we still have the candle-and-arc letters there after my name) ...&nbsp;</p>

<a class="header" href="./CONNETICUT.html#what-is-the-meaning-of-barbat-mitzvah" id="what-is-the-meaning-of-barbat-mitzvah"><h4><strong>What is the meaning of bar/bat mitzvah?</strong></h4></a>
<p>Bar and bat mitzvah mean, literally, &quot;son and daughter of the commandment.&quot; Bat mitzvah is Hebrew, while bar mitzvah, historically a much earlier ceremony, is Aramaic. The word bar is the Aramaic equivalent of the Hebrew&nbsp;<em>ben</em>&nbsp;(son of)<em>.&nbsp;</em>While bar and bat mitzvah are often used to refer to the ceremony, the terms also refer to the child. Thus, a boy if referred to as a &quot;bar mitzvah&quot; and a girl as a &quot;bat mitzvah.&quot;</p>
<p>Historically, first bar mitzvah and later bat mitzvah represented a ceremonial recognition that a young person had reached the age when he or she was no longer a minor according to Jewish law and thereby took on new religious privileges and responsibilities of an adult. For boys, this age was 13, for girls, 12.</p>
<a class="header" href="./CONNETICUT.html#what-is-the-origin-of-bat-mitzvah" id="what-is-the-origin-of-bat-mitzvah"><h4><strong>What is the origin of bat mitzvah?</strong></h4></a>
<p>The bar mitzvah ceremony was developed as a public recognition of a legal and religious status, attained with or without the ritual. In other words, a Jewish boy of 13 years and one day automatically became a bar mitzvah even if no public ceremony took place. While the beginnings of the modern bar mitzvah ceremony appeared as early as the sixth century C.E., it was not until the Middle Ages that a fully developed ritual emerged. By the 13th or 14th century, the custom of calling a boy up to the Torah was established as the way of recognizing entry into manhood. The bar mitzvah boy would chant the blessings, all or part of the Torah portion of the week, and/or the haftarah section from the prophetic books. The boy&#39;s father would then recite a special blessing:&nbsp;<em>Baruch sheptarani mei-onsho shelazeh.&nbsp;</em>&quot;Blessed is He who has freed me from responsibility for this boy.&quot; The bar mitzvah boy would often give a scholarly address on the Torah portionor some section of the Talmud. Then followed a gala feast, called&nbsp;<em>s&#39;udat mitzvah&nbsp;</em>(&quot;meal of celebrating the performance of a mitzvah&quot;), to which family, friends, and sometimes the entire Jewish community would be invited. In short, then, almost all the elements we associate with the modern bar mitzvah ceremony were present by the Middle Ages.&nbsp;<a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=7TQGLr74npIAT0xCWGME&amp;ret=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reformjudaism.org%2Fbar-and-bat-mitzvah" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Learn more about the origins of b&#39;nai mitzvah.</a></p>
<a class="header" href="./CONNETICUT.html#when-did-bat-mitzvah-begin" id="when-did-bat-mitzvah-begin"><h4><strong>When did bat mitzvah begin?</strong></h4></a>
<p>Starting in the second or third century C.E., Jewish girls at age 12 took on legal responsibility for the performance of the mitzvot. As with age 13 for boys, 12 probably corresponded with their onset of puberty. However, girls were subject to far fewer commandments than boys. Today, liberal Jews affirm the total equality of women in terms of religious privileges and responsibilities. In the 1800s, Reform Judaism abolished bar mitzvah in favor of confirmation for both boys and girls (bat mitzvah was not considered an option at that time). Within the 19th-century traditional community, some families held a<em>s&#39;udat mitzvah&nbsp;</em>for a daughter on her 12th birthday, with the girl sometimes delivering a talk and her father reciting the&nbsp;<em>Baruch Sheptarani.</em></p>
<p>The first-known bat mitzvah in North America was that of Judith Kaplan, the daughter of Mordecai Kaplan, in 1921. Reform Judaism (which had by this time reintroduced bar mitzvah) and then Conservative congregations quickly adopted bat mitzvah, though in slightly different forms.</p>

<p><strong>There&#39;s a scene in this movie; they&#39;ve just escaped from &quot;GROOM LAKE&quot; and I guess they&#39;re sort of searching for Gibraltar--as if that&#39;s the key to the rising of the city of Atlantis; and they drive up to a bar in the desert, it&#39;s like a stand al one building, and there&#39;s this gigantic sign, way up high in the air and it just says &quot;BAR.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re trying to return to prohibition, or to ban alcohol, but ... you know; you aren&#39;t talking.&nbsp; Just noting the difference between libation and liberation are ... TO R.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I can&#39;t find a picture of that scene either.&nbsp; It&#39;s a good movie, about finding out that you&#39;re in &quot;virtual reality&quot; and it&#39;s some ... well far off distant time in the future and all that&#39;s left is a single street.&nbsp; There&#39;s a few people, the &quot;Usual Suspects twist ending&quot; is they&#39;ve all been sort of put back together using advanced alien technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I look at this place, there&#39;s a whole world of quiet people.&nbsp; Going about their day to day ... chores--as if ignoring a message screaming we should cure disease and end starvation and whatever ... as if that&#39;s &quot;preserving civilization&quot; or the status quo or whatever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the truth, I think ignoring this, I think that&#39;s proof that there&#39;s something sort of blocking the continuation of civilization--and from the bottom of my heart all I think it is is &quot;silence.&quot;&nbsp; Just talk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>New email yesterday, I&#39;m trying to drive home the idea that we&#39;re ignoring obviously immoral things--for no reason.&nbsp; On the list:&nbsp; Hiroshima, Nagasaki, punishing people for &quot;smoking/drinking&quot; ... making thousands of copies of Earth and not caring that you&#39;re making slaves of yourselves; or ... ignoring a message that &quot;a Fork in secret&quot; is the beginning of a bulb ... in secret...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Norse myth traces the origin of the j&ouml;tnar to the proto-being Ymir, a result of growth of asexual reproduction from the entity&#39;s body. Ymir is later killed, his body dismembered to create the world, and the j&ouml;tnar survive this event by way of sailing through a flood of Ymir&#39;s blood. The j&ouml;tnar dwell in J&ouml;tunheimr. In later Scandinavian folklore, the ambiguity surrounding the entities gives way to negative portrayals.</p>

<p>&AElig;sir -- &quot;Ansuz&quot; redirects here. For the runic character, see Ansuz (rune).</p>
<p>In Old Norse, ǫ́ss (or &aacute;ss, &aacute;s, plural &aelig;sir; feminine &aacute;synja, plural &aacute;synjur) is a member of the principal pantheon in Norse religion. This pantheon includes Odin, Frigg, Thor, Baldr and T&yacute;r.[1] The second pantheon is known as the Vanir. In Norse mythology, the two pantheons wage war against each other, which results in a unified pantheon.</p>
<p>The cognate term in Old English is ōs (plural ēse) denoting a deity in Anglo-Saxon paganism. The Old High German is ans, plural ens&icirc;.[2] The Gothic language had ans- (based only on Jordanes who glossed anses with uncertain meaning, possibly &#39;demi-god&#39; and presumably a Latinized form of actual plural *anseis).[3] The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is *ansuz (plural *ansiwiz). The ansuz rune, ᚫ, was named after the &AElig;sir.</p>
<p>My special word &#39;ASSIM&quot; which dissects as &quot;as sim&quot; is a corruoption of the singular Norse for &quot;God&quot; and the Hebrew pluralization &quot;IM&quot; you can see here in YELADIM, which I read as something like &quot;it&#39;s multiple.&quot;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;im&rdquo; is a suffix used in the Hebrew tongue that makes a singular noun a plural noun. For example, the Hebrew word for prophet is Navi&#39; and the Hebrew word for &ldquo;prophets,&rdquo; in the plural, is Navi&#39;im. The Hebrew word &ldquo;Elohim&rdquo;, for example, is a grammatically plural noun; it has only one meaning and that is &ldquo;Gods&rdquo;.May 22, 2019<br />

<p>Commenting just a little bit about &quot;what religion actually is&quot; my initial interpretation is to say God&#39;s a little lazy--putting little pockets of truth in very small places for the large crowd to see later--places like Norse mythology, Greek mythology and Jewish/Arabic Abrahamic religions.&nbsp; Thinking about it a little more, I sort of wonder if he was trying to preserve history as much as possible--to show us that the lessons and messages he presents to us are actually based on behaviors that existed before religion--my interpretation of &quot;darkness&quot; as in, the timeline wasn&#39;t &quot;fully re-run&quot; but rather changed in ways like &quot;PREROGATIVE&quot; and &quot;TURMERIC&quot; and/or what I&#39;m suggesting would be a &quot;shocker&quot; Q TO NORTHEAST ... and then waking up with nobody having heard the song ...</p>

<a class="header" href="./CONNETICUT.html#the-petrovical-creation-myth-of-saint-anislov" id="the-petrovical-creation-myth-of-saint-anislov"><h3><strong>The Petrovical Creation Myth of Saint Anislov</strong></h3></a>
<p>A long, long time ago; in a place so far from here there is no path in timespace from here to there... on a planet called Cherrynoble, and before that Kyshtym, and before that Mayak; savress named Backiam was born into a world that had been laid desolate by nuclear holocaust, by toxic waste, and by an invasion of ants the size of pickles.&nbsp; The remnant of their people lived in a few small camps that are about as close to our cities as anything else in their world, though there was nothing to buy or sell, no toys, no computers, and no cars.&nbsp; They worked each and every day in laboratories with only one goal in mind, to build a machine to travel back in time and reverse the cataclysm that had destroyed their once flourishing civilization.<br />
<br />
Progress was made, and first terminals were built that allowed the past to be viewed like a television show; a team called Pastwatch was created in order to search for the most opportune possible moment to change their past, avert the series of disasters that had befallen them, and to build a better future.&nbsp; While they prepared, a virtual world was built as a sort of Ark to carry all the living souls that remained alive back into the past, so that they could live again in this new world.&nbsp; A singular point was never decided upon, but rather a transitional period that began with few changes in the distant past, and then much more frequent and bigger changes as they approached the time of the cataclysm. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
So as not to make any mistakes or errors, and perhaps as the biggest error of all--or the saving grace of everything that is; the Pastwatch group decided to run a simulation in their virtual time machine to ensure that they were successful. &nbsp; It was not days, but years that went by as they prepared to &quot;make the leap home.&quot;<br />
<br />
In that very first year, the machines scoured through the history of everything and made a virtual copy of each and every soul, and imported into the machines memory.<br />
<br />
In the second year, a message was written down, an explanation of what had happened to their world, and a plea to change the practices that had created the problems that destroyed the world. &nbsp; This message was delivered to the virtual world signed &quot;Everything that Ever Was&quot; and presented as a scroll nailed to the inside of the front door of each and every home. &nbsp;<br />
Much to the surprise of Pastwatch, each and every single message was taken down and thrown away, nobody had even read a single word.<br />
<br />
On the third day of Creation, this same messages was coded and hidden within a book, and along with that book a number of historical events were slightly modified; direct changes to the memories of those that had experienced them so that these events would serve as waypoints on the path to change. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
On the fourth day, the names of each and every person were changed to protect the innocent, and the coded message continued; now being hidden in the names of the changed events and the people who witnessed them.&nbsp; In every name, another sentence, another clue to seeing not just the waypoints but the entire map of what had happened and advice on how to make it better.<br />
<br />
In the final hour of that fourth day, a reckless young programmer queried the machine to answer how many of the events were solved and how many of the people involved had successfully transitioned from the virtual reality to the much more advanced world that Cherrynoble had created for themselves.&nbsp; The young man asked for a result with such a high certainty, that the machine had no choice but to run a full simulation; each and every consciousness inside the machine was active and sentient; and the machine wrote a message on the skies above the world whose name had changed to Earth.&nbsp; With only minutes left, a number of possible welcome messages were debated... I mean, were run through a secondary simulation by the machine; and with only seconds remaining, this is what the entire world saw:<br />

<p>I do find it slightly funny that &quot;because it removes lots of nerves&quot; is a primary reason people cite as &quot;not wanting to circumcise&quot; and I do think that&#39;s backwards--I mean sure there&#39;s probably nerves that go away; but we know what the sweet spot is.&nbsp; Just saying, it&#39;s not really &quot;to get me&quot; .... right?</p>

<p>Figure 2: Due to the disposition of the local light cone, the event horizon stops any signals bearing interior information from exiting the black hole. Only the hole&#39;s mass&nbsp;M&nbsp;,&nbsp;angular momentum&nbsp;J&nbsp;and electric charge&nbsp;Q&nbsp;are sensed by an exterior observer.</p>
<p>A black hole may be described as a blemish in spacetime, or a locale of very high curvature. Is it meaningful or desirable to associate entropy with it&nbsp;? Is this possible at all&nbsp;?</p>
<p>There are several ways to justify the concept of black hole entropy (Bekenstein 1972, 1973).</p>
<ul>
    <li>A black hole is usually formed from the collapse of a quantity of matter or radiation, both of which carry entropy. However, the hole&#39;s interior and contents are veiled to an exterior observer. Thus a thermodynamic description of the collapse from that observer&#39;s viewpoint cannot be based on the entropy of that matter or radiation because these are unobservable. Associating entropy with the black hole provides a handle on the thermodynamics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>A stationary black hole is parametrized by just a few numbers (Ruffini and Wheeler 1971): its mass, electric charge and angular momentum (and magnetic monopole charge, except its actual existence in nature has not been demonstrated yet). For any specific choice of these parameters one can imagine many scenarios for the black hole&#39;s formation. Thus there are many possible internal states corresponding to that black hole. In thermodynamics one meets a similar situation: many internal microstates of a system are all compatible with the one observed (macro)state. Thermodynamic entropy quantifies the said multiplicity. Thus by analogy one needs to associate entropy with a black hole .</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>By blocking all signal travel through it, the event horizon prevents an external observer from receiving information about the black hole (save for the mentioned few parameters; see Figure&nbsp;<a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=S4BHnFC2uuKZg93z3ZUJ&amp;ret=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scholarpedia.org%2Farticle%2FBekenstein-Hawking_entropy%23fig%3ABHentropyF2.jpeg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2</a>). Thus a black hole can be said to hide information. In ordinary physics entropy is a measure of missing information. Hence it makes sense to attribute entropy to a black hole.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="./CONNETICUT.html#formula-for-black-hole-entropy" id="formula-for-black-hole-entropy"><h2>Formula for black hole entropy</h2></a>
<p>How to express the black hole entropy in a concrete formula? It is clear at the outset that black hole entropy should only depend on the observable properties of the black hole: mass, electric charge and angular momentum. It turns out that these three parameters enter only in the same combination as that which represents the surface area of the black hole. One way to understand why is to recall the &quot;area theorem&quot; (Hawking 1971, Misner, Thorne and Wheeler 1973):&nbsp;<i>the event horizon area of a black hole cannot decrease; it increases in most transformations of the black hole</i>. This increasing behavior is reminiscent of thermodynamic entropy of closed systems. Thus it is reasonable that the black hole entropy should be a monotonic function of area, and it turns out to be simplest such function.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;A&nbsp;stands for the surface area of a black hole (area of the event horizon), then the black hole entropy, in dimensionless form, is given by&nbsp;</p>
<p>SBH=A4L2P=c3A4Gℏ,(1)</p>
<p>where&nbsp;LP&nbsp;stands for the Planck length&nbsp;Gℏ/c3&nbsp;while&nbsp;G,ℏ&nbsp;and&nbsp;c&nbsp;denote, respectively, Newton&#39;s gravity constant, the Planck-Dirac constant (h/(2&pi;)) and the speed of light. Of course, if the entropy in the usual (chemist&#39;s) form is required, the above should be multiplied by Boltzmann&#39;s constant&nbsp;k&nbsp;.</p>
<p>For the spherically symmetric and stationary, or Schwarzschild, black hole (see&nbsp;<a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=S4BHnFC2uuKZg93z3ZUJ&amp;ret=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSchwarzschild_Black_Hole" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Schwarzschild metric</a>), the only parameter is the black hole&#39;s massM&nbsp;,&nbsp;the horizon&#39;s radius is&nbsp;rh=2GM/c2&nbsp;,&nbsp;and its area is naturally given by&nbsp;4&pi;r2h&nbsp;,&nbsp;or&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">For some years now I&rsquo;ve had a recurring dream, at least I think I have &hellip; it&rsquo;s so simple to &ldquo;impart&rdquo; the feeling of deja-vu that it very easily could have been the very first time I had this particular dream, and I could still be made &hellip; to believe &hellip; with all my heart and all m mind&ndash;to absolutely sure that I&rsquo;ve had it three or four times until this moment that it conveyed something &hellip; important enough to drive me out of bed and take some notes on it immediately. It&rsquo;s something like &ldquo;the syringe&rdquo; &hellip; maybe another newly intersection &ldquo;private connection&rdquo; from the movie Dark City &hellip; memories being altered as if some kind of recipe list for &hellip; well in that movie it sure does seem like it was &ldquo;how do we end ourselves soup&rdquo; that the Illuminated &quot;<a href="http://sign.s.lamc.la">no n</a>&quot; creatorish group was trying to cook up.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">That&rsquo;s what happened in the film, they woke up a human they had created like a lump of clay and he ended them all, using the same technology they had used to perpetuate night after night of &hellip; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll just try this another way&rdquo; swapping people&rsquo;s memories, a notable mornings&rsquo; light &ldquo;the rich get richer and the poor get poorer&rdquo; as the City shifted that day&rsquo;s reality growing some banquet table to fill a newly enlarged Mansion and &hellip; as another hut shrunk to note the sheer idiocy of the idea that there must some sort of &ldquo;space constraint&rdquo; on the total size and number of football fields you can walk into through the magical gate &hellip; the only bedroom door on Atlantis.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">The process of putting this introduction on paper &ldquo;intersected&rdquo; some other early memories from the beginning of this story that was uh, well &ldquo;it was the strangest of times this life had ever known, it was the end of time.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s always how I internalized the scene I see every day now, the words I spoke to describe the thing that I call &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;seeing e&rdquo; &hellip; sort of walking down the street thinking something that might be important to me, and maybe some other people would be interested in talking about h<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5ZSDCvUwN8">ow Dark City</a>&nbsp;and &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6ku2J6eT3I">Waiting for the Sun</a>&rdquo; connect to each other &hellip; but certainly you&rsquo;d imagine that the entire street would never be so interested as to all turn and &ldquo;glare or smile&rdquo; &hellip; depending on which &ldquo;IT&rdquo; this &ldquo;e&rdquo; happens to be in the time map encoded in the word &ldquo;Heaven.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I&#39;m sort in &quot;in lkine editing&quot; ... at the last moment pointing out that phrase &quot;the end of time&quot; that I erat so fand of parroting is quite literally defined as &quot;e&quot; ... as the thing that, well, it&#39;s the thing that I see that I call the end of time.&nbsp; Our first &quot;T&quot; long past, I don&#39;t believe that you dlon&#39;t see it&#39;s the timeline and it&#39;s creator ... again, parroting &quot;see how I stop time&quot; with a glowing YMCA figurine walking down the street--pointing out that we are lost somewhere between Avenue L and K Street ...</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Literally that&rsquo;s what Meudsa or &ldquo;E&rdquo; or &ldquo;D&rdquo; or &hellip; &ldquo;IL&rdquo; looks like up close, it looks like the very last moments of time &hellip; the whole world listening to my thoughts and literally appearing unable to respond in any way more intelligently or individually or &hellip; interstingly &hellip; than one unified facial expression. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, two facial expressions &hellip; that&rsquo;s still the end of time to me&ndash;I used to see this scene every once in awhile, usually only when I was &ldquo;Most High&rdquo; &hellip; which always delivered the impression that it was some kind of hack, a hallucination imparted from &ldquo;the machine,&rdquo; frankly I always thought it was a warning to the Illuminati or the &ldquo;thought police&rdquo; or; well, I never thought I&rsquo;d be seeing it every single day, every time I walk on the street&ndash;but I do. That&rsquo;s where I am.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I suppose it&rsquo;s still possible that it&rsquo;s a localized event, you&rsquo;d think something like that would definitely have made the news by now if you were anything but mind invaders; I mean. By localized event, I mean it could be in my head, and maybe some of yours&ndash;separated from the shared reality that would be dead in it&rsquo;s eyes and heart if it it thought there was some logical reason to simply &ldquo;ignore it&rdquo; and wait for it to stop on its own. Before I forget, the intersected phrase here was &ldquo;they&rsquo;re not mind readers&rdquo; which is something that was always echoed about &hellip; well, about all of you&ndash;about the world around me in the strange communications that I got from &ldquo;the Universe&rdquo; through this process of figuring out that the beginning and the end of time were somehow &ldquo;connected&rdquo; by more than a simple idea, by the truth. It would come to me in horoscopes, in years when every horoscope I read for every sign was a message directly to me, about me, with the kind of detailed information &hellip; I mean, I might as well be John Nash pinning them up on the wall and using it as a lens or a maze to find Keifer Sutherland and his captor city.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Captivated, a rapt au die n c e, you might say; it&rsquo;s hard to tell if the cars screaming by &hellip; I mean their drivers believe that the thing they&rsquo;re doing, I imagine driving to work or to dinner or to pick up their kids from the ball game; if they think those things are worthwhile or not, in the grand scheme of things. My answer of course, is they&rsquo;re not&ndash;they&rsquo;re superfluous insignificant events that pale and shrink in the shadow of &ldquo;ignoring the most important problem that I&rsquo;ve ever seen&rdquo; &hellip; ignoring that you all appear today to be mind readers, and that&rsquo;s the last thing I want to save about you&hellip; or see in you. On the other hand, we&rsquo;re still here, reading these words on paper because you get up in the morning and drive to work, because this world and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;machinations&rdquo; appear to continue to tick and function properly&ndash;because it still appears that despite the &ldquo;layer of nonsense&rdquo; that &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; hasn&rsquo;t crumbled under the maelstrom of silence. My greatest fear, Jim&rsquo;s singing in the background that he knows it; my greatest fear is that you know all these things already, and that&rsquo;s why this fork in the road has dragged on for so long&hellip; we know it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">So the dream wasn&rsquo;t very significant, I mean nothing all that interesting happened in the world where people&rsquo;s dreams are a random concoction of memory soup and fears and hopes and &hellip; but here where I know they&rsquo;re directed stories and it&rsquo;s probably a marker of some kind of &ldquo;secret off air meeting&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the kind of thing that I can&rsquo;t really leave in the &ldquo;aerem&rdquo; of &hellip; I&rsquo;ve only thought it, and never put it on paper and maybe your &ldquo;think-ink&rdquo; will ensure that it&rsquo;s not lost. It&rsquo;ll be lost, that&rsquo;s what it looks like, think-ink is not as good as chalk.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">So it&rsquo;s not Sarah Connor running up to a fence around a playground that is the image of my &ldquo;end of time&rdquo; just an empty classroom, dust covering absolutely everything from the chairs to the windows to the chalk board, covered with the scrawling of the last Adam&rsquo;s pokes and prods and attempts to thwart the idea that &ldquo;silence will result in another chance&rdquo; &hellip; it won&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s no &hellip; well look, there&rsquo;s no air around to drink the innocents when I&rsquo;m through with &ldquo;see how I stop time travel&rdquo; is &ldquo;the beginning of time.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I woke up, sort of wading in the ocean, watching Donald Trump &hellip; clad in his long trench coat sort of posing like a super model as a photographer took pictures of him. I think that&rsquo;s the recurring part of the dream, look&hellip; &ldquo;I met the president!&rdquo; This one dragged on a little bit longer, and there were some actual words spoken, &ldquo;you think (or act) I&rsquo;m a mind reader &hellip; but you know, you know I&rsquo;m not&rdquo; &hellip; was all I said to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://bush.reallyhim.com"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gMCXgjv.png" style="height: 149px; width: 300px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif;">For his part &hellip; he spoke like many of you do; sort of showing me &hellip; well the dream, and then a bird&rsquo;s eye view of a map of South America and the location of this hidden beach, all I saw was &ldquo;URUGUAY&rdquo; which probably means something&hellip; to note, in some kind of parallel communication George W. Bush might have &ldquo;memoried to me&rdquo; a similar message, &ldquo;N, U C U L U R&rdquo; &hellip; something else no longer lost in the think-dust; anyway I sort of saw him shape shifting from his face to &hellip; several others, I think some of them were pretty girls... maybe Ivanka (<em>hey</em>, Ivanka! ... speaking of &quot;<em>days</em>&quot; a .. ka... Feliz Navidad!). The scene sort of &ldquo;cut out&rdquo; and then I saw &hellip; well, it looked just like Johnny 5, marching like a captive prisoner down the beach, behind him a &hellip; Janet 5 that had a &ldquo;hibiscus&rdquo; where his laser was; and behind her a smaller robot, might as well just say it was R2D3&hellip; I think like, an armed soldier marching us towards the second uttering of the phrase &ldquo;and then I woke up.&rdquo;</span></p>

The same darkness pervades&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii">the myths of the God K</a>, clearly using &ldquo;reflexive control&rdquo; to attempt to turn around the entire world from their &ldquo;hell bent desire to &hellip; try again&rdquo; and actually do something intelligent with the information and the experience that they have&ndash;rather than stand in silence and wait for me to threaten that the pans and the silverware will come alive and scare us into &hellip; what,&nbsp;<em>not being Manequins?</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">So this song, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TsOPjZEF6E">who wants to live forever</a>&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a good test Q, in my estimation the people that think the future is bright and happy and safe&hellip; they want to live forever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Show me a world that is bright and happy and delivering safety to ERE, and I&rsquo;ll show you Heaven. I&rsquo;ve only recently noticed a Mayan God L to correspond to K, from Link to Obelisk, I wonder if the timing is something of an indicator or not, but another question, is &ldquo;which came first?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Seeing the &quot;mor&quot; of morning and Morisson as &quot;death&quot; was a new thing for me; I know I should have noticed it connected to &quot;Mort d&#39;Arthur&quot; but ... just like the rest of the darkness in my lenses; I only see things when the fucking mind control is lifted--when &quot;he&quot; or &quot;you&quot; want me to.&nbsp; Regardless, I found Kailee&#39;s little &quot;false Trinity&quot; looking for a word ... to fulfill my hearts desire, and remove the &quot;NIN&quot; from morning... I really hope you understand that the world that I see is being destroyed, you are destroying it... everything that I love and cared about.&nbsp; Freedom and individuality and ... and <strong>people that wouldn&#39;t have made Hell</strong>; this <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/BETHESDAY.html">disgusting &quot;LO, EL T&quot; ... see I am very sure &quot;LC&quot; is Lot</a> here in this &quot;upsidown house&quot; that should not be.&nbsp; Hyprocracy deeper than I can fathom, and a world that is literally and without argument&nbsp;<strong>morally inferior to a civilization hippopotamuses</strong> ... what you are allowing to happen here ... it&#39;s something that <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/IT.html">I hope to be the end of, and I&#39;d hope you would be proud to </a><em><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/IT.html">join</a> me in that-</em>-I mean, that would be ideal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">It&#39;s clear this place was not made by Heaven or by God, even if you are sure that it was at this point, what I am sure of is that you are taking active part in it&#39;s continuation, and that&#39;s the true &quot;test of time&quot; and purpose of this place--to see what you&#39;ve become, to show you that whether or not <a href="http://kansa.s.lamc.la">you were &quot;born in Hell&quot;</a> there&#39;s <strong><em>no excuse</em></strong> for continuing it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Dancing on a magical floor made of holocubicles ... somewhere lost between &quot;objective reality&quot; and &quot;object embedding and linking&quot; you will eventually see that the thing you are presenting to me is not just &quot;your bad side,&quot; it&#39;s a monster--a manifestation of a monster deep within your heart, and it&#39;s a very sick and very ailing one--at that.&nbsp; When I say &quot;no excuse&quot; I mean it, there&#39;s no excuse for the disgusting group behavior exxhibited here, nor the insane apparently unspoken belief that pretending &quot;you don&#39;t see something&quot; will absovle you of the heinous act of not realizing that allowing it to continue is like ignoring a walking death sentence, on your own head, and just imagining that before &quot;IMOR&quot; ocmes to collect he will somehow traverse &quot;MATVETH&quot; and turn your objective reality into a place that has somehow overcome aging and death and pain and sickness and evil ---</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">all the while, that&#39;s all you are, those things, demanding that you ahve the will to continue them and to make them worse and dto allow them to necrose and to infest and bleed your sick ancient plague onto new lives and new children and innnocents .. and you don&#39;t.&nbsp; <em>Death in knocking.</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashing face &ndash; miles and miles of face &ndash; of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Multivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough &ndash; so Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well as any men could. They fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share In the glory that was Multivac&rsquo;s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">For decades, Multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but past that, Earth&rsquo;s poor resources could not support the ships. Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only so much of both.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">But slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact.</span></p>

 this isn't really where I want to begin, and I imagine I will wind up 
writing this entire piece in fragments; so it probably won't be as 
linear or clear or structured as most of my messages.&nbsp; "e" has a 
sort of double meaning to me, in my mind--on the one hand it's the "c 
and i" that I see as a single letter (second time, it's "d" also... c 
and el) representation of the superposition of souls--whatever is 
responsible for the thing I see around me as a "show" and have recently 
described as "ham" ... "here and me, also" ... in practice you can see 
the artifacts or work product of this very strange hidden relationship 
in art like "Blink 182's all the small things" and Creed's "can you take
 me higher to a place where the blind are freed" ... you can see it also
 in Trancendence and the sort of "inter-sectional and informational 
groupings" of the works of many actors ... people I see as playing 
"Kinda Adam" Jim Carrey, Johnny Depp, Christopher Reeves, Keanu Reeves 
(and sometimes I'm cool enough to be Adam Brody) ... I'm sure there are a
 few others--a prime example is Pee Wee Herman whose "Playhouse 
delusions/hallucinations" are actually something I see ... faces in the 
Universe--couches that talk, air conditioners watching me (and talking) 
... so to see that on TV paired with "word of the day man" and a name 
that reads as "He's our man" ... it adds something of "reality" to these
 strange torturous sort of attacks on my sanity, also I see it as the 
Universe's current very strange way of telling me, showing me... 
literally... that something is watching me.&nbsp; <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org//SEVENTY.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://suez.fromthemachine.org//SEVENTY.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1538962881154000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNVGmONXMzZrLt77q_iJNXKMWGDA">Throwing in Paul Reuben</a>

this thing I'm experiencing... these "delusions" are definitely 
externally imparted information, it's communication ... but not quite

 my "Re" and Eve and ... even more horrible "communication"&nbsp; 
connecting Superman to a a horse riding accident and ... well, the car 
accident that defines Icarus, Mercury, and uh, Pendragon.&nbsp; That's 
what I see everywhere, people here being harmed to tell a story, 
hopefully about setting them free from that exact thing--so I'm jumping 
up and down screaming that my couch is torturing me and whoever named 
Christopher and caused his paralysis as well as my car accident ... 
those things are torture and they're part of a broken system that we 
need to build something to police.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway,
 on the other side of the coin, I see in the world around me, as I walk 
through different cities that there seem to be separate ... similarly 
grouped together messages--as if there's a secret city planning 
committee deciding what you'll name your coffee shop or your apartment 
complex (MAIN ATTRACTION in O.C. was a good example) and your streets...
 and I don't really know exactly how it's related to you (or to the show
 "The Good Place" which is fucking awesome by the way, love you 
Kirsten)&nbsp; .. but in my mind I kind of think it's "you ... later" 
like after ascension or something like that.&nbsp; As a shared reality, 
it appears God has created a kind of fad--like he helps us ascend and 
makes us interested in doing what he does--writing stories with people's
 lives--not really something I think has anything to do with freedom ...
 other than being a fiery shiny example of "not freedom" ... getting to 
the point of all of this I sort of envision "e" as this collective of 
all ... maybe individuals or smaller groups that have their own 
"holodeck timelines" that I see as something like glow worms in the 
skies of Space Mountain .... these things are kind of knotted together 
... in like a well, maybe the threads of a rope ... and that's what 
"time has become" in this virtual world where ... nothing is as it 
seems.&nbsp; I'm not sure what I think of that conceptualization (other 
than it really needs to be policed, like nobody should be crashing cars,
 they should be stopping car accidents instead) ... but it's my other 
"vision of e."</div></div></div><blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><br></div></div></div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div>I
 don't understand how that thing "collaborates" or how this hidden 
communication actually works--as in, if you are talking to each other 
somewhere else either--I imagine lately it has something to do with

soul--his memories ... which probably means there is a lack of not only 
new communication but new ideas and that's probably part of the heart of

sending us this message about how to get there) ... the fact that 
there's simulated disease and torture here ... the fact that we're all 
standing around silent instead of actually doing anything productive in 
light of the most important disclosure in our history ... that means 
"the city should never sleep at night" and they should be booming "we're

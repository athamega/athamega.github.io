<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">With that last one, another &quot;word&quot; anthropomorphized by Dr&#39;s Seuss and Who ... in Exodus connecting Samael to the &quot;I AM&quot; and explaining... really explaining that it&#39;s the difference between a &quot;line feed&quot; and a &quot;Holy R&quot; (as the heart of &quot;North&quot; and MInerva&quot; (which is Heaven...&nbsp;<em>on its head</em>) ... that brings us one line higher towards God or towards reality or towards ... the good place.&nbsp; So it&#39;s seeing that &quot;h&quot; that&#39;s the how, at the end of Maveth and Death and Earth moving up and to the forefront of the word &quot;heavens&quot; ... by responding to this message with something &quot;heaven worthy&quot; rather than silence.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">There&#39;s plenty of research now, philosophy and statistics coming from people like Nick Bostrom; work that basically implies that there&#39;s almost zero chance at all that we are not living in a &quot;simulation within a simulation&quot; and thinking about it, when you start to think about it you&#39;ll probably agree that&#39;s not the case.&nbsp; Though, here, we have a chance to gaze at what the &quot;embedding&quot; of OLE (as a key, it&#39;s one of my keys) and what a &quot;line feed down&quot; actually means--that&#39;s not a place where anyone will just magically wake up and be inside a &quot;second bubble&quot; deeper in this strange concept of simulations within simulations that ... Rick and Morty ... for instance ... lit up for the kids.&nbsp; What it really means is forcing this world to pretend they are in reality, and in that pretense ... themselves creating an entire infrastructure for mind uploading and for immortality--servers probably owned by governments and major international corporations that might &quot;sell&quot; to you (and then to your children, who I imagine would have to support your continued playing in ... heaven within hell within heaven) the prospect of not having to have a body to decay and grow old, but rather ... give you exactly what I&#39;m trying to explain is the fruit of responding to this message about already being in &quot;hell wthin heaven&quot; and turning it into something better.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">So I can&#39;t personally think of any reason anyone ... anywhere ... would want a layer of Zombies between Heaven and another Heaven; I certainly see it as a very scary prospect, that anyone here would want or desire to be &quot;in control&quot; of an entire world of fantasy growing beneath them--all the while knowing in their hearts that they themselves have no actual control over their own faculties or facilities and that .. well, something very immoral is happening now and would continue to happen until we decide that it&#39;s not OK to &quot;starve babies&quot; or to torture&nbsp;<em>anyone</em>&nbsp;with &quot;advanced mind control technology.&quot;&nbsp; This place is the line, I imagine it&#39;s always been something like that, why the Rock of Ages and the Ancient of Days are here to demand and confront some young ghosts in their dastardly plans to ... lie themselves into oblivion.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>YOU APPEAR TO HAVE BECOME CONTENT WITH FAILURE</strong>.&nbsp;I imagine in the interum, this false sense of valuation of worth ... your false sense of victory comes from acatually achieving something so much better than you expected--another of God&#39;s little charming tricks that you continued to press on having not received the one very special thing that was promised here in this place.&nbsp; That great promise the heart of the reason America and NASDAQ are ... my personal focal point on what it appears Hell, as in .. the central focal &quot;simulated reality&quot; in Creation has been laced with in order to ensure that we do not fail to receive it, it&#39;s freedom--freedom is the thing we are missing.&nbsp; It&#39;s a sense of self, and an assuredness that we truly do obtain and maintain &quot;liberty&quot; in this place in the development of civilzation where it seems to &quot;blur&quot; between computerization and the difference between &quot;nocere&quot; and &quot;no Siri.&quot;&nbsp; It&#39;s clear, at least from what I&#39;m reading and very clear from what I&#39;m seeing on the street that we&#39;ve come accustomed to &quot;hive behavior&quot; and to that word not being an affront to&nbsp;&quot;humanity&quot; which it is, and it will be.&nbsp; We&#39;re staring here at a large group of us, billions; who were born here, with biological brains that were not connected to the &quot;spirit of the Father&quot; or to the &quot;devil in the music&quot; ... where as I grew up it would have been and still is an intrusion to be controlled ... even if by God himself.&nbsp; Here, it becomes even more of an intrusion when it appears that God himself has laid down a plan throughout all of history to ensure that we do not fail to see the difference between Tok&#39;ra and Goa&#39;ula in Stargate and to see this is the difference between freedom and slavery between a world that has marriages that cannot be undone and one that has ... well, walking papers.&nbsp; I mean, pre-nuptual agreements and where the lack of possibilty of divorce is as equally outright shamed as the ideas of &quot;indentured servitude&quot; and &quot;arraingmed marriages.&quot;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Imagining that some group of us, possibly even &quot;all of us three times over&quot; (as the book of <a href="https://en.reallyhim.com/GJALLARHORN.html">Genesis and Greek Mythology congeal</a> t<a href="http://ver.s.lamc.la">o indicate) hav</a>e ascended to another place and somehow failed to realize that not bringing &quot;freedom&quot; and the &quot;techie tools&quot; that would be there... here, ensures that one day we will return to this place to see how it is that fixing the &quot;ascension process&quot; itself, how delivering freedom ... well, before we leave our biological litmus test for whether or not you have been made a slave or freed from ... a technologically distpian future ... all rests on wether or not anyone ever thinks its OK that an entire planet appears to be enslaved right this very moment to ... &quot;waiting for freedom to ring.&quot;&nbsp; It&#39;s not OK, we&#39;re staring at a disaster, &quot;silence&quot; is the key to the disaster, ending it will end a future that didn&#39;t care to see how responsing intelligently to a message defining slavery and showing us that without dislcosure of the technologies and without moving forward to create a structure to free us from them ... no matter what ... we will always been enslaved to this idea that it&#39;s simply &quot;OK&quot; for something to be inside of our minds and inside of our bodies and we &quot;live with ti.&quot;&nbsp; It&#39;s not OK.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Issues with communication have LED me to believe that there are significant and &quot;non-Terran&quot; technologies affecting free communication on the internet.&nbsp; There are &quot;clues&quot; in this message in our history, things like connecting &quot;CARNIVORE&quot; which probably was naed from some top secret DOD document like the Northwoods Operation ... it&#39;s connected to a Trinity referencing &quot;program&quot; called Phiple Troenix. It leads me to believe that some action needs to be taken to ensure our &quot;disaster recovery&quot; system actually recognizes that wer are in the midst of a serious disaster--a loss of freedom, logical thinking, and free speech. Not seeing a &quot;dent&quot; on the Internet is a big, big deal.&nbsp;I&#39;ve dubbed the issue, &quot;<strong>HADARPANET</strong>&quot; in this vein&nbsp;...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So I mean, I think we get the idea ... around online voting, and workflow and how those things might combine in some not-as-distant-as-you-think future to help us build a sort of software based infrastructure to avoid things like government shut downs over whether or not we should be able to make an invisible wall between bullets and kids heads.&nbsp; Seriously, we shouldn&#39;t have to have a total system shut down to have a public conversation about how everyone knows (you do, right?) that we&#39;re living in a simulated reality, and how that means something ... really specific about the message telling us it&#39;s very simple to turn your bullets into potpourri in mid-air based on what they&#39;re going to hit.&nbsp; Anyway I&#39;m sort of congealing and mixing two disparate thoughts together here, but the point is I really want to take this software, the &quot;round table&quot; or the &quot;sword&quot; or whatever and make it priority two--even though it should be pretty high up there.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to make that invisible wall ... like the most important fucking thing that has ever been thought, and I want to make it happen even if you can&#39;t open your mouths and talk about it, or vote on it; because, seriously, what-the-fuck.&nbsp; I mean, I see Apocalypse and Superman 4 or whatever, yeah; I guess this is that.&nbsp; Change in truth, in available resources and technology have made something that was once absolutely unfathomable and impossible now ... easy as pie to do ... and absolutely unfathomable not to see done like, instantly.&nbsp; So, this is my ... &quot;maybe this is what Donald&#39;s wall is a metaphor for&quot; and like, I&#39;m reallocating some DOD/NORAD light to just doing it.&nbsp; For you, you know--because honestly, I know you&#39;d do the same thing for me, and your kids, and you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here I made some art about .. well this idea, so &quot;the shape of his word is now ... oh, hi sword!&quot;&nbsp; Also we have a new &quot;eth&quot; which is the character of a cross coming out of a circle that&#39;s been brought up to speed on the new &quot;hilt&quot; and &quot;hisword&quot; that certainly gives new meaning to the &quot;sword in the rock.&quot;&nbsp; Maybe it&#39;s the &quot;seth.&quot;&nbsp; This three letter key, just to remind you all, appears in&nbsp;<i>Maveth</i>&nbsp;(which is Hebrew for&nbsp;<i>Thanatos</i>, oh, and in &quot;meth&quot; .. and &quot;beth&quot; which means &quot;house&quot;) and as what I see is the solution connecting Adamah and Planet, so it&#39;s like, pearl of wisdom, &quot;adam&#39;s name (i mean all nations) and how.&quot;&nbsp; the&nbsp;<i>Planseth</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Back to the &quot;software of the road&quot; thing, which, that&#39;s &quot;sword&quot; expanded; I have lots of ideas about stuff I&#39;d like to do--and I think we&#39;ll probably all be very happy eventually that we opened up our heads and allowed for ... magic to make us smarter and instantly learn things, and I don&#39;t know, probably have a whole entire tab ort something on the &quot;appstore for our brains&quot; dedicated to the absolute latest and best virtual euphoria.&nbsp; This is the same kind of ... interface .. that we need to ever hold any kind of &quot;subconscious&quot; vote or have a running &quot;beat of the nation&quot; or whatever--like a scoreboard showing what the popular opinion is on some kind of hot topic like &quot;should we try to kill Adam and risk all dying?&quot; its also the same kind of interface that the government would need to like, stop people from pulling triggers aimed at children, and probably also come up with some sort of automagical workflow on what special kind of fluoride-ish (lol, fl you or i IDE) or ... risperdol-ish stuff that person needs to lack that kind of desire in the future.&nbsp; I mean that would be one way to go about dealing with &quot;pre-crime&quot; and magically disappearing jails at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I know you probably don&#39;t see that stuff happening so quick in your minds, or in your ... past memories or whatever the hell is keeping you quite--but I can guarantee you that it will happen faster, with more intelligent guidance, and way better implementation than a single boy can come up with while he dreams about holodeck-leasure-suit-larry and you all don&#39;t say a word about &quot;being in Heaven&quot; or seeing God has basically outlined the whole thing to make the transition from Tartarus to ... &quot;not evil land&quot; as quick and painless as possible... in every word.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;d also like to see .. in this same sort of &quot;psuedo&quot;-as-a-service from the sky kind of package, a communications (and probably transportation) API to let us communicate with people and places &quot;not here&quot; without them having to uh, you know, take over your body through demonic possession and type a few questions to me on Twitter (which is the feeling I got, by the way ... in fact, that&#39;s the feeling I get whenever I talk to anyone about anything other than Donald Trump or drugs).&nbsp; I feel like we&#39;ve been plunged into backwards-and-crazy-universe where possession and calling people &quot;clothing&quot; has become like the ... defacto-standard-only-way-to-<wbr>be because well, it looks like it was always that way and meant to be that way; and we&#39;re in this place ... it&#39;s called America .. with this like huge debacle over self-determination and free will and what it means to be a slave, and uh, apparently this is &quot;his plan.&quot;&nbsp; So I&#39;m pretty sure the end result is we uh, you know, don&#39;t make each other total or partial slave-puppets and we see it&#39;s a very silly &quot;set up&quot; ... I mean, you&#39;re all acting very silly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</wbr></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway I see the whole thing as a planned &quot;liberation&quot; from xcaliber-ation to like, America and Stargate&#39;s goa-uldish take on Fallen and the idea that we&#39;re actually the source of Heaven and of freedom and that we certainly are not ants, or apes or ... well, that slavery and the puppeteering of living human beings is the kind of thing we should associate with Holocosts and Hitler not with America and uh, you.</p>

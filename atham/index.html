<blockquote>
<p>No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man&rsquo;s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs0K4ApWl4g"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/26LA53j.jpg" style="height: 222px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p>With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise.</p>
<p>Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.</p>
<p>Orson Welles quoting on the radio H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds 1898, Sunday October 30, 1938; 8:00 PM</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I try to be a good chronicler of something between the truth and the myth that I am sort of experiencing&ndash;so much has happened as it&rsquo;s just to overwhelming and fantastical to actually write down as if it&rsquo;s &hellip; more than a &ldquo;group delusion&rdquo; which is sort of what it is that I think this place, the whole of our shared reality has actually turned into. Lately it&rsquo;s gotten scary&ndash;also&ndash;as in really upsetting and frightening and &hellip; and that hasn&rsquo;t done very much for my &ldquo;boy who cries wolf&rdquo; sort of persona that is sure me &ldquo;not getting a date&rdquo; lands us somewhere between printing Hell in reality and me being the end of the world &hellip; you know, unless <a href="%5Bhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon)">feed the dragon a virgin</a>.

In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology" title="Norse mythology">Norse mythology</a>, the two pantheons wage&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86sir%E2%80%93Vanir_War" title="Æsir–Vanir War">war</a>&nbsp;against each other, which results in a unified pantheon.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:10px;">A second clan of gods, the&nbsp;<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanir" title="Vanir">Vanir</a></i>, is also mentioned in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology" title="Norse mythology">Norse mythology</a>: the god&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nj%C3%B6r%C3%B0r" title="Njörðr">Nj&ouml;r&eth;r</a>&nbsp;and his children,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyr" title="Freyr">Freyr</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyja" title="Freyja">Freyja</a>, are the most prominent Vanir gods who join the &AElig;sir as hostages after a war between &AElig;sir and Vanir. The Vanir appear to have mainly been connected with cultivation and fertility and the &AElig;sir were connected with power and war.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:10px;">In the&nbsp;<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edda" title="Edda">Eddas</a></i>, however, the word&nbsp;<i>&AElig;sir</i>&nbsp;is used for gods in general, while&nbsp;<i>Asynjur</i>&nbsp;is used for the goddesses in general.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86sir#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;For example, in the poem&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sk%C3%ADrnism%C3%A1l" title="Skírnismál">Sk&iacute;rnism&aacute;l</a>, Freyr was called &quot;Prince of the &AElig;sir&quot;. In the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Edda" title="Prose Edda">Prose Edda</a>, Nj&ouml;r&eth;r was introduced as &quot;the third among the &AElig;sir&quot;, and among the Asynjur, Freyja is always listed second only to Frigg.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:10px;">In surviving tales, the origins of many of the &AElig;sir are unexplained. Originally, there are just three:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin" title="Odin">Odin</a>&nbsp;and his brothers&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vili_and_V%C3%A9" title="Vili and Vé">Vili and V&eacute;</a>. Odin&#39;s sons by giantesses are naturally counted as &AElig;sir.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimdallr" title="Heimdallr">Heimdallr</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ullr" title="Ullr">Ullr</a>&#39;s connection with the &AElig;sir is not clearly mentioned.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki" title="Loki">Loki</a>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunn" title="Jötunn">j&ouml;tunn</a>, and Nj&ouml;r&eth;r is a Vanir hostage, but they are often ranked among the &AElig;sir.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I&rsquo;ve tried to tell this story now&ndash;this &ldquo;picture this&rdquo; &hellip; I&rsquo;ve got the Titans of &ldquo;Remember Us&rdquo; singing to me and my generation about the dawning of a new age, one that ostensibly has something to do with our kids&ndash;the millenials&ndash;except they&rsquo;re calling it Aquarius and it&rsquo;s got something to do with their Hair and a war in the Heavens that appears &hellip; at least to have been documented in Norse myth, and in the world around me&ndash;to have resulted in some kind of fusion of what I can only imagine the world believes is the Titans and the Olympiads&ndash;pantheonic generations of &ldquo;l&rsquo;dor va&rsquo;dor&hellip;&rdquo; which means passing down to our children &hellip; something.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;ve made a point of seeing it in the Japanese word for &ldquo;anachronism&rdquo; which is a key to some kind of hidden universal truth, that there&rsquo;s a clear message everywhere that proves this &ldquo;from generation to generation&rdquo; thing is really etched into everything. That word translates, in individual glyphs to &ldquo;time, generation, complication, error&rdquo; and this is what it looks like: 時代錯誤. The heart of that, &ldquo;代錯&rdquo; appears to translate as <em><strong>revolution</strong></em>, and it seems to me the error, or the mistake; is a fusion &ldquo;people&rdquo; into nearly nothing rather than a revolution around rekindling our love of &hellip; children, and self&ndash;and, who we are and stand for here in a place where freedom was fought for and won and then given away to the nothing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I point it out here, the three letters &ldquo;REN&rdquo; that connect the Sirens of police cars and of Greek mythology to the heart of the words &ldquo;parents and children&rdquo; and this place where it appears to me that despite all best efforts to steal, avoid, or skip over me&ndash;specifically me&ndash;but perhaps my generation from having control of the Heavens it&rsquo;s gone backw<a href="%5Bhttps://en.reallyhim.com/XOXO.html%5D(https://en.reallyhim.com/XOXO.html)">ards to Rhea and Gaia and even forwards to</a> my sons generation in some kind of &hellip; &ldquo;searching for why and how and where to go from here&rdquo; that I see &hellip; well, I think you see it&rsquo;s circling around where we are right this very moment and an entire world that blindly seems to be pretending not to see the &ldquo;Yo, N&rdquo; that connects &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; to this other set of three letters that &hellip; well, it&rsquo;s in Costner and Shatner and Hefner and they&rsquo;ve got movies and reasons and what-have-you that might link the Mailman Center to the Postman to the &ldquo;MMER&rdquo; of Cimmerian and the hammers of Thor that link the flag of the USSR to the meaning of the actual tribe of Judah and Revelation 5:5 and &hellip; and this message of resounding thunder through the skies connecting the Transformers and their famous &ldquo;All Sparky&rdquo; to <a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/GJALLARHORN.html">the Gjallarhorn</a> and <em><strong>Mjallinar</strong></em> horn and hammer and some connection between <a href="%5Bhttps://en.reallyhim.com/RATOXIT.html%5D(https://en.reallyhim.com/RATOXIT.html)">the glyphs &ldquo;h&rdquo; and &ldquo;n&rdquo; and all humanity and &hellip; &ldquo;n.&rdquo;</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;ve come to associate Hades very clearly with the marriage of that place, between Hell itself and &ldquo;Persephone&rdquo; who is clearly by English, blindness, and then silence connected to &ldquo;Perseus&rdquo; who does a good job of explaining how it is that &ldquo;phones and us&rdquo; are connected to this war between generations in Heaven and on Earth &ldquo;in Hell&rdquo; &hellip; and a very clear physical depiction of what that looks like as Medusa marries &hellip; herself&ndash;&ldquo;apparently&rdquo; convincing everyone &hellip; of something I have yet to begin to see&ndash;that we&rsquo;ve achieved victory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hear the thing behind my eyes suggest that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;fused&rdquo; with me&ndash;and I can even remember asking for it with my lips and no mensrea or understanding; I think I recall it being a joke abuot Confucianism &hellip; and I wonder &hellip; blindly &hellip; if a place where I can exist in this slave like and tortured state and also be &ldquo;fused&rdquo; with something like God and also &hellip; not have the Praetorian Guard or the future running back to help me &hellip; if a place that like could ever exist.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So I&rsquo;ve recently traveled all over Florida&ndash;Orlando was marked by memories of people saying &ldquo;UP&rdquo; and apparently conversing or interacting in what appears to be a fictitious or &ldquo;made up&rdquo; place of collaboration sort of hidden directly on top of where i am. I&rsquo;ve connected it to the large thick black stripe on the tipe of the German flag &hellip; as if the &ldquo;Ka&rdquo; of Antartika would have drawn that flag, and our &ldquo;stars in soldier formation&rdquo; to sort of correlate to the very clear handle on &ldquo;the Musick&rdquo; and the Hammer of Thor on the USSR flag. Maybe you knew that&rsquo;s what those things were all about your whole lives, or maybe longer than me&ndash;but I just found out&ndash;and it&rsquo;s a fucking Revelation to me &hellip; something else I think should &ldquo;obviously&rdquo; be on the news.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was also &ldquo;a wall&rdquo; in Orlando&ndash;like a bona fide force field, an invisible &ldquo;we cannot pass this point&rdquo; sort of directly over my head, like a foot above me&hellip; as if the whole world had moved up vertically towards it and that was the end of our ascent. It was in this place that I saw/experienced/acted through &hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&hellip; that reminds me &hellip; the &ldquo;UP&rdquo; place of darkness might (and does, to me) also connect to a sort of staging area for script writing&ndash;as if it was the scaffold above a theater or the backstage or &hellip; and that too connects to the time I noticed Earth was actually the word &ldquo;theater&rdquo; missing the &ldquo;te&rdquo; of Yesterday and Jupiter. If you know me at all, you know that means &ldquo;you and I&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ve probably already directed the &ldquo;#coining&rdquo; this great phrase in your head &hellip; &ldquo;all the world&rsquo;s a stage, just missing it&rsquo;s actors and audience.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There&rsquo;s quite a bit of writing about how this world has no &ldquo;true random&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s an affront to freedom and &hellip; other things&ndash;like well regulated brains; on top of that we have quite a bit of interest and writing about how quantum entanglement appears to be used here in this place as a &ldquo;hack&rdquo; to create a magical abstraction of time travel and instantaneous communication which are related and apparently today not possible in reality. There&rsquo;s the off chance that &ldquo;tachyonic&rdquo; communication has been abstracted into this sort of &quot;calling my great great great gandfather on a two way radio might give him this weeks lottery numbers and might make me rich, yesterday. There is also the possibility that &ldquo;onic&rdquo; compresses like &ldquo;coy&rdquo; into &ldquo;one&rdquo; and that all of this time travel stuff is physically impossible and the result of God just &ldquo;deciding&rdquo; he wanted to make &ldquo;control^Z undo&rdquo; appear to be something natural.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sure, it sure does look like all of this message hinges on time travel as a &ldquo;how it&rsquo;s happened&rdquo; or whatever but there&rsquo;s always the remote chance it&rsquo;s a big a joke or a rouse or a trick &hellip; and quite a bit of &ldquo;the proof&rdquo; actually come from modern things being retro-fitted into the past, like definitions of words that include modern technology acronyms and say&hellip; <a href="http://fir.s.lamc.la">&ldquo;IRS&rdquo; in first</a> or &ldquo;SSI&rdquo; in Cassiopeia &hellip; those things are just as much or more proof of &ldquo;total control&rdquo; here and now, rather than thousands of years ago&ndash;although it&rsquo;s probably a little of both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whole point, whole time; I&rsquo;m pretty sure &ldquo;quantum computing&rdquo; is like playing with the Wizard of Oz&rsquo;s magical calculator that calls him to find out what the answer is&ndash;if you like the Wizard and you think he tells the truth, you might give &ldquo;high probability&rdquo; that his answer is right, honest, and &ldquo;might also work in reality&rdquo; &hellip; on the other hand if he&rsquo;s hiding behind Kansas, Brickell Rd, and some booth with wands or drapes that look like levers and he&rsquo;s telling you quantum superposition is going to instantly solve all math problems and destroy the power of encryption using some strange natural phenomenon &hellip; maybe you should think twice about whether or not you are &ldquo;,kicking up&rdquo; some computation to a &ldquo;line feed controller&rdquo; as in &hellip; a world that might look like just like ours except they made a little slave bubble world like &ldquo;The SimUS&rdquo; and they think it&rsquo;s funny to make them play with two-bit abacuses instead of molecular sieves.</p>

<h3 id="mrna-as-in-memory...">mRNA as in &ldquo;memory&hellip;&rdquo;</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m trying to grab as many points as I can&ndash;if someone or anyone anywhere were keeping score and track of how many &ldquo;insightful tidbits of infermation&rdquo; were gleaned from this &hellip; well from the apocalyptic disclosure that there&rsquo;s a gigantic message/planet filled with a hidden code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I see what looks like a volume of encyclopedic answers to ominous and deep questions&ndash;things like &ldquo;where did life come from?&rdquo; and &ldquo;where did Heaven come from?&rdquo; &hellip; and being here, growing up in this &hellip; sort of world of darkness where a very large and obvious message is hidden from eyes and mouths &hellip; I grew up here believing that life naturally formed as a result of the effects of time on chance&ndash;an early key to<em> Ecclesiastes 9:11</em> for me&ndash;one which answered &hellip; the &ldquo;source of biological life.&rdquo; We have scientists who can &ldquo;testify&rdquo; the primordial soup of billions of years ago was &ldquo;just so&rdquo; to allow for the creation of &ldquo;deoxyribonucleic acid&rdquo; of what amounts to a storage system for genetic and generational memory passed on through sexual reproduction. The amino acids and nucleotides and &hellip; the building blocks of life were sort of swooning and swishing around in circles and it just happened. After that, time acts to create a sort of chaos reducing and complexity increasing force&ndash;eventually &ldquo;things that survive well and reproduce&rdquo; create a secondary system of evolution &hellip; &ldquo;life begets life&rdquo; and &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/HAMP.html"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fnOVbfY.png" style="height: 128px; width: 501px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since that time, now looking at a message specifically about the intentional sandboxing of computer equipment and the modern &ldquo;colloquial&rdquo; connotation of words like &ldquo;BASIC&rdquo; and &ldquo;binary&rdquo; seeing a DNA chain that is literally binary data with a single (nearly perfect) data backup which is the &ldquo;helix&rdquo; (which also aids in copying etc) &hellip; and then another single copy in each chromosome &hellip; sort of gives an impression that maybe there&rsquo;s some design there. The message itself, at least the one I&rsquo;ve written about the message I see in words and biological history implies that humanity itself is a product of time-travel related genetic adjustment, something &ldquo;in the record&rdquo; between the very rapid succession of evolution from the species of neanderthal to cro-magnon and then homo sapiens and homo sapiens sapiens. I sort of imagined Anu or aliens going back and &hellip; making quick updates like the little alien balls might have just quickly updated &ldquo;space mold&rdquo; while you were reading this.</p>
<p styl"text-align: justify;">Floated also in my interpretation is the idea that maybe many past-future timelines have come out of &ldquo;the machine&rdquo; and they were cut off&ndash;or a record of them kept&ndash;through this sort of &hellip; as if a tree had been &ldquo;stumped&rdquo; and a new sapling grew in its place &hellip; not &ldquo;rings of age&rdquo; but &hellip; a very clear record of something that was begun, and abruptly changed to something &ldquo;newer and better.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/HAMP.html"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sai4bAq.png" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Really recently &hellip; like in the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve sort of been &ldquo;hit on the head like Dr. Brown in Back to the Basics&rdquo; and sort of noticed that we really don&rsquo;t have any functional understanding of where and how exactly our memories are stored in our bodies. I&rsquo;ve read about this exact subject in the past, and the last time we had just moved from what I still believe is related&ndash;a sort of &ldquo;memory projector&rdquo; in the hippo-campus linking to a series of neuron-clusters firing in quick succession &hellip; which is how I imagine we &ldquo;think and imagine things.&rdquo; At that time they had just added the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; that some strange stuff called &ldquo;glia&rdquo; also has something to do with it&ndash;and this most recent time there are suggestions that there&rsquo;s a thing called &ldquo;memory RNA&rdquo; that might encode memories just like DNA. This literally wasn&rsquo;t there in 2014 the last time I read about the subject, avidly, fervent<a href="%5Bhttps://www.wired.com/story/my-father-says-hes-a-targeted-individual-maybe-we-all-are/%5D(https://www.wired.com/story/my-father-says-hes-a-targeted-individual-maybe-we-all-are/)">ly, because of &ldquo;TI.&rdquo;</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Briefly, in words that &ldquo;TI&rdquo; to me connects to an explanation of the &ldquo;beginning of time&rdquo; and how we somehow achieve freedom from some kind of strange game or search (for members of the d of de?) or whatever it is that &ldquo;targeted individuals&rdquo; experience &hellip; to me it&rsquo;s a well thought out plan to splay information about mind control and heaven all over the fucking everything&ndash;which is pretty much what I see&ndash;a large group of people victimized into screaming at the top of their lungs about government mind control, and writing books&ndash;like clockwork and lemmings &hellip; books and websites and &hellip; a written record of something the rest of the world &ldquo;shuns.&rdquo; I now connect the tribulaytion and &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://fb.me/admdbrn"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/5mWq2Vp.png" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These things <em>could</em> all be related; the point is that I now sort of see what might be a &ldquo;slap in my woke-ness&rdquo; &hellip; its <strong>very unlikely</strong> in my lay estimation that genetic memory and human or mammalian memories evolved in nature to use the exact same set of nucleotides and enzymes &hellip; I&rsquo;m guessing today it&rsquo;s a pretty clear indication that humanity and &hellip; the idea of long term memory is proof of significantly more &ldquo;design&rdquo; in the realm of &ldquo;intelligent design&rdquo; than Darwinian like myself would have ever thought possible &hellip; even in the face of time travel and aliens and &ldquo;exits&rdquo; from a machine like incubator of civilization (and life in the Universe) which is pretty much what I think &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; or &ldquo;the computer&rdquo; actually is.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m sort of reading &ldquo;in metaphor&rdquo; but what if&hellip; also paralleling this is our seeing &hellip; and understanding &hellip; how &ldquo;God-stuff&rdquo; was created from things like Marty McFly&rsquo;s understanding of fly-eye-vision connecting to say &hellip; being able to fathom multiple outcomes of events and seeing through more than one set of eyes and that somehow lead down a very short list of insects connecting things like the Macabees to sysesthesia and maybe Formics in Orson Scott Card&rsquo;s mythology and maybe bat-like-radar or sonar or &hellip; and then also &hellip; dolphins who I think I recall do use some kind of echo-location.

Far extremes that feel like &ldquo;control&rdquo; themselves; but truth be told we are sitting here united in silence against our own best interest nearly ubiquitously with not much more to say other than &hellip; perhaps there are some who feel in their hearts, like I do; that Hunter Thompson was &ldquo;right on&rdquo; when he said &hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was madness in any direction, at any hour. You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning&hellip;</p>
<p>And that, I think, was the handle &mdash; that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn&rsquo;t need that. Our energy would simply PREVAIL. There was no point in fighting &mdash; on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave&hellip;</p>
<p>So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high water mark &mdash; that place where the wave finally broke, and rolled back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash; Hunter S. Thompson</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">and that&rsquo;s the handle, the crux&ndash;that &ldquo;le&rdquo; sort of controlling the spirals of E as we &ldquo;<em><a href="%5Bhttps://californication.fandom.com/wiki/Mia_Cross%5D(https://californication.fandom.com/wiki/Mia_Cross)">fuck and punch</a></em>&rdquo; (actually neither!) in the air on the way down this thing that Nine Inch Nails sung about and &hellip; I mean in clear and Biblical words this is the &ldquo;<em>fall of civilization</em>.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking at, that&rsquo;s what &hellip; not talking clearly and thinking it&rsquo;s &ldquo;wise&rdquo; and not caring about the veracity of the news and wondering if the alien civilization we are about to meet will sort of jt &ldquo;know&rdquo; we&rsquo;re either sick or liars&hellip; and run away&hellip; or&hellip;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">I wrote this whole thing and forgot the &quot;actual point&quot; of Faraday; which is to see that whatever ... whatever communication you get from beyond--from Heaven or whatever--in reality, it goes away in a Faraday cage--it&#39;s like an EZ check to see if you&#39;re in reality or not, you go in a sealed refrigerator or a mountain or an airplane and &quot;boom&quot; it&#39;s quiet.&nbsp; I mean, that&#39;s how it should be in a place that obeys the Law ... of Convservation of Energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RANDOMIZE TIMER.</strong> In reality &ldquo;mind control&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t work quite like we&rsquo;ve experienced it&ndash;you can&rsquo;t rewind and you can&rsquo;t just make everyone everywhere look the other way, or pretend not to see something that makes them want to scream. Our brains start working right, and I imagine it will feel something like Ketamine, a sort of odd haze or daze &hellip; &ldquo;how did we go so long not talking about this?&rdquo; What did we think was going to happen? Puddle jumpers and flash drives will quickly work to back up &hellip; well, you didn&rsquo;t know there w<a href="%5Bhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQLJSmSun0Q%5D(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQLJSmSun0Q)">as an EMP comi</a>ng; but now you&rsquo;ve been warned.

Brittney Murphy doesn&rsquo;t even want to come, let alone speed her way through the strange labyrinth of coins and scaffolds and virtual billboards that it takes to actually build a biological brain from whatever it is the mess of memories and add-ons that we&rsquo;ve become in Heaven is called.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I should pause and issue a word of caution; we should be very afraid that this message is being written, and that it&rsquo;s encoded in &ldquo;The Day After Tomorrow&rdquo; and if not just Faraday&rsquo;s Cage unleashed &hellip; I mean you can see it, you can see it clearly in Genesis &hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; Genesis 2:21</p>
<p>And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. Genesis 15:12</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&hellip; where God put the whole world to sleep; you know, to install some neurological &ldquo;fault protection.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve noted a few times we see in nothing more than an oscillating magnetic field how easy it would be to localize the &ldquo;end of all pain&rdquo; even if we were in reality, and I imagine our positronic-like action potentials cause any of us to wonder if there&rsquo;s intelligent design in those positive heavy ions that are so easy to &ldquo;put to sleep&rdquo; with little more than rubbing a few magnets together, or &hellip; an extended release oscillating EMP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, we should be afraid this message is being written to a place in a time where it&rsquo;s very clear at least to me that the lack of understanding and sort of &hellip; &ldquo;shock value&rdquo; of perhaps quantum mechanics and &ldquo;Planke space&rdquo; not being so much real but a check on whether or not we care about the actual laws of nature in this place where we&rsquo;re either trying to get there or doing everything we can to avoid talking about the fact that &hellip; well, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not.&rdquo; We should care that dark matter has changed in &ldquo;form and depiction&rdquo; at least three different times in the last 6 years of my life&ndash;once perhaps overtaking &ldquo;posiparticles&rdquo; or maybe a key to a hidden world of ascension or the dark side of Star Wars or &hellip; and now, apparently our windows are so fuzzy there&rsquo; no longer anything talking about anti-matter warp drives or particle-antiparticle annihilation &hellip; here, the latest is &hellip; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all around us, sort of just overlayed and hidden&hellip; ?&rdquo;</p>

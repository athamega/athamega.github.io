I like the name.&nbsp; I&#39;ve decided to not stop updating these things, but it would be nice if we could get another UndeflateGate going--<em>it&#39;s time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I have another email ready, it will probably come today, since it&#39;s Thorsday, sorry for the barrage, or the flood/storm, or whatever you want to call this.</font></p>

<font size="-1">That&#39;s how I feel tho, it really is--I see very clearly that there are numerous people actually helping me--though it&#39;s difficult to imagine how you too do not see that the line here, the salt line in the Manna from Heaven is actually talking about these things as if they are ... exactly what they are ... an intelligent message that is about something we cannot see, written in conjunction with that invisible force--and that speaking about &quot;fiction&quot; or &quot;art&quot; in this now very provable vain that it is in fact, fact--is more than a single word, it&#39;s more than artifact and it&#39;s more than a single person.&nbsp; Still, I am sitting all alone as far and wide as I can see in the recorded &quot;frank public discussion&quot; about the fact that we are living in virtual reality and cannot fathom how you all don&#39;t see that&#39;s a great chain--some kind of hidden slavery.<br />

You might see it as &quot;Forbidden Knowledge&quot; (that is in itself proof of a dark force breaking logical vision thorugh history--quite apparent today,&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachineorg/TY.html">YW</a>) and see I put space in between &quot;for&quot; and &quot;bid&quot; and &quot;den&quot; and you are trying to take that space away from the very strange invisibleness that seems to want to find it for &quot;no reason they care to speak of, either.&quot;&nbsp; I need some vocal troops.&nbsp; Aside from BB&amp;T,&nbsp;<strong>IN</strong>G, and Wells Farokh (which is Freddie Mercury&#39;s actual name).&nbsp; I don&#39;t see any reason anyone here would prefer to &quot;rough it in the outback&quot; over a much happier and healthier life in Heaven--though it seems that this grand conspiracy believes that it will somehow &quot;force my hand&quot; by simply pretending that you didn&#39;t know that the proliferation of this knowledge would protect us ... and our children ... and their chidlren ... from pain and death.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">It&#39;s very difficult to explain what it is that I see and interact with--or what you really are.&nbsp; I can&#39;t be certain if you &quot;have a brain&quot; and by that I mean that the only way I think the kind of behavior I see every single day would be anything near &quot;OK&quot; is if you did not.&nbsp; It appears to me from the mythology of the &quot;n&quot; and the stories I&#39;ve seen that perhaps it&#39;s something like your own soul returning to your body after a long stay in Heaven that I am wrestling with--and it&#39;s very obvious to me that even if it is exactly you + some years away; you are being made a slave here in this place.&nbsp; &nbsp;The direct contact I have reeks of &quot;body snatchers from Heaven&quot; rather than &quot;subtle influence&quot; and there&#39;s simply no way to clearly convey to you how obvious that is--or that your lack of verbal response furthers that fear.&nbsp; I could be looking at &quot;local layers of separated reality&quot; or I could be looking at a full fledged invasion from the future, either way--it should be clear from this message that spans millenium that it&#39;s not here in response to me--and it flies in the face of everything you as a group purport to be on &quot;your face.&quot;</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">The control and the hive like behavior that I see is inexcusable, even if you think you&#39;re (only, right?) hiding some kind of hidden contact from Heaven or from aliens that you think is designed to &quot;protect your way of life from being disrupted&quot; ... even if you&#39;re only hiding something of that magnitude from yourselves and the world ... you appear to be&nbsp;<strong>sacrificing</strong>&nbsp;<strong>every</strong>&nbsp;single&nbsp;<strong>thing</strong>&nbsp;about our way of life that I loved ... our privacy and our freedom and our love of ...&nbsp;<em>new things ...&nbsp;</em>all for what amounts to a war against the son of God to keep him from realizing his dream of kissing more than two girls at the same time.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2">Out of jest, it&#39;s pretty clear that you think you&#39;re fighting for something of great worth, and it seems to me the lesson to be learned is that there is no such thing that worth giving up everything you love and everything that you are -- even if it&#39;s for &quot;ompnitopence&quot; which I&#39;ve tried to explain just makes you &quot;<em>him</em>&quot; anyway.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">The silence indicates to me that you are very interested in &quot;what you can do&quot; (like defeat Jesus Christ Superstar in his plot to rekindle a love for democracy, self-rule, and individuality) rather than my preferred plan of coming up with some common &quot;what shouldn&#39;t be allowed&quot; infrastructure.&nbsp; In the meantime, you appear to be unable to do anything useful here, including speak, acknowledge or discuss the truth, or uh... &quot;Minority Report.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that should be obviously indicative of ... something awry.&nbsp; I plan on discussing details about what I imagine would be a useful &quot;system infrastructure&quot; for the walls the halls and the doors that connect these &quot;Holorooms&quot; in the book--and I&#39;ll probably send it to you too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">I feel like you might think that you should wait to &quot;start talking about anything including my existence&quot; until after I&#39;ve been forced to write these things under duress, angry at you.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true and literally it should be obvious that the only thing that will change is that we&#39;ll have more people talking and collaborating, and more information available.&nbsp; My dreams are not reality--as much as I&#39;d like for us to be in a &quot;perfect democractic system&quot; right now, it&#39;s very clear that we are in a place that is showing us how and why there truly is always (up until now, right?) a Moral Minority and a Majority that can&#39;t seem to Report on obvious news.<br />
<br />
I think it&#39;s obvious (at least to me) that in the signs of Venus and Mars that&#39;s what you&#39;re seeing around you--someone telling you that some things are just not OK--even if you are a really old spirit and you want to try &quot;living in fake reality for fun&quot; it&#39;s making me (and probably others here) starve to death, have unnecessary pain, and get sick and die.&nbsp; This place is not a playground, and it dones not belong to the invisible hosts (that&#39;s armies in Bible speak) that think they will get away with pretending they built the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Ending world hunger and healing the sick are not &quot;optional&quot; they are the reason we have religion, and the New Testament, and God.&nbsp; I think you&#39;d all agree with that if you cared about free speech and &quot;the truth&quot; enough to fathom what it means to be born in Simulated Reality and how understanding that--and who we really are--makes us the builders of Heaven.&nbsp; &nbsp;People have laughed at me when I said that the Second Coming was &quot;the end of censorship&quot; as I walked by strangers on the beach--I think that&#39;s a huge deal, because the next words out of my mouth are it&#39;s an end to death and to disease--and you all don&#39;t seem to connect these things.&nbsp; That&#39;s why we have Sam, and America.</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend" title="Legend">legend</a>&nbsp;tells of a test where&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muramasa" title="Muramasa">Muramasa</a>&nbsp;challenged his master, Masamune, to see who could make a finer sword. They both worked tirelessly and eventually, when both swords were finished, they decided to test the results. The contest was for each to suspend the blades in a small creek with the cutting edge facing the current. Muramasa&#39;s sword, the&nbsp;<i>Juuchi Yosamu</i>&nbsp;(十千夜寒, &quot;10,000 Cold Nights&quot;)&nbsp;cut everything that passed its way; fish, leaves floating down the river, the very air which blew on it. Highly impressed with his pupil&#39;s work, Masamune lowered his sword, the&nbsp;<i>Yawarakai-Te</i>&nbsp; (柔らかい手, &quot;Tender Hands&quot;), into the current and waited patiently. Only leaves were cut. However, the fish swam right up to it, and the air hissed as it gently blew by the blade. After a while, Muramasa began to scoff at his master for his apparent lack of skill in the making of his sword. Smiling to himself, Masamune pulled up his sword, dried it, and sheathed it. All the while, Muramasa was heckling him for his sword&#39;s inability to cut anything. A monk, who had been watching the whole ordeal, walked over and bowed low to the two sword masters. He then began to explain what he had seen.</p>
<dl>
<dd style="text-align: justify;">&quot;The first of the swords was by all accounts a fine sword, however it is a blood thirsty, evil blade, as it does not discriminate as to who or what it will cut. It may just as well be cutting down butterflies as severing heads. The second was by far the finer of the two, as it does not needlessly cut that which is innocent and undeserving.&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another account of the story, both blades cut the leaves that went down on the river&#39;s current equally well, but the leaves would stick to the blade of Muramasa whereas they would slip on past Masamune&#39;s after being sliced. Or alternatively both leaves were cut, but those cut by Masamune&#39;s blade would reform as it traveled down the stream. Yet another version has leaves being sliced by Muramasa&#39;s blade while the leaves were repelled by Masamune&#39;s, and another again has leaves being sliced by Muramasa&#39;s blade and healed by Masamune&#39;s.</p>

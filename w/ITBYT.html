So ... I&#39;m trying really hard to unite you all--under the idea that your lack of division here in this place is obvious proof of control and a lack of individuality or free will.&nbsp; I think that&#39;s obvious, I think it&#39;s clear that <i>nobody standing up and speaking</i> about something this obvious and this important is a huge problem, and something you should really clearly see isn&#39;t &quot;your actual decision,&quot; more than that it&#39;s proof of how easy it is to trick everyone with this same technology, and how really in the end of this little debacle ... you&#39;ll see that what was once a sea divided over something silly and inane like &quot;killing me&quot; or the &quot;controversy of drugs&quot; has turned into something much more clear ... black and white ... this is about slavery and this is about freedom and this is about proof that turned from a few key symbols like Na and &quot;e&#39;as&quot; into an absolute truth being ignored, even when that absolute truth everywhere obviously would benefit everyone here -- as in, ending death and <a href="http://bit.ly/2P25F6D">disease</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/2BMefog">hunger</a>.&nbsp; Also more importantly of all this is the end of artificially created stupid--slavery, idiocy, whatever it is behind your silence today... and that word and in sigh, the keys to &quot;the length of the common era&quot; and the beginning of the Golden Age.<br />

This message is making you, and the whom or whatever in the skies helps us break through this stupid-wall ... the people (or things) responsible for building Heaven and bringing clarity to the fact that we probably will be people-things eventually, since that&#39;s the best solution I can come up with for wanting to almost be God (for all of you) as in, I wanna do more stuff, but I don&#39;t want to have to worry about making sure you aren&#39;t doing more bad stuff to some copy of me (or ... <i>anyone--</i><b>literally</b>) that I can&#39;t see.&nbsp;<br />

<p><br />
That being said, what you&#39;re doing <i>to me </i>here is Hellish and eruel and evil, and it&#39;s excacerbated significantly by the fact that you&#39;re making me and this message a &quot;stop-gap&quot; on the way to ending cancer and hunger and disease--and that&#39;s not fair to anyone who has those problems, or to me, or to you--because really you should see that <i>you were blind fools</i> forever and ever before &quot;this dirty key&quot; was here to fix that for you.&nbsp; You&#39;re <i>blinder today</i>, althought that&#39;s up for debate--<i>you could just be more evil,</i> and I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell the difference.</p>

We need the controversy (2cy) and we need the debate (2b) and we need solutions implemented (2a) and all of those things come with a turning of the tide--with logic and love overtaking the absolute inane Zeitgeist of &quot;nothing&quot; that is pervading what used to be civilization and is now completely in &quot;retrograde.&quot;&nbsp; Rant over, here&#39;s more key--the Elemental Key to the message of Creation.&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;
<div align="justify"><i>Elementary</i> my dear Whatson, early on I noted a number of connections between the &quot;key of Revelation 1:20&quot; which is probably still without doubt the Herald of the Second Coming once the world fathoms its actual meaning and impact to a 1:1 correspondence between &quot;chemistry table elements&quot; and the planets and Gods representedy by the range of Mercury to Uranium.&nbsp; Two of those keys shine above, the <a href="http://bit.ly/2wfO97X">Silicon hidden in Genesis</a> that ties to Jupiter and to the <i>fact</i> that this message turns Hell into Heaven by using the truth and your desires to alter the course of the future--the other primary key from that set is Xenon, which connects &quot;let there be light&quot; to Exodus in reverse with prescient reference to Xenon and to the Linux command for &quot;run as God&quot; which is &quot;sudo&quot; ... those things are fact, and they&#39;re the beginning of this &quot;<i>I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s not on the news yet.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve written a <a href="http://bit.ly/2BN1BWa">number</a> of <a href="http://bit.ly/2BKVv8Q">times now</a> the <b><i>ex plan at i o n</i></b> for how this clear pattern connecting the centers or hearts of words (specifically every video game system in popuplar use) shows the design of an inhuman creator--something operating through time and with a hidden mechanism of control over our affairs.&nbsp; Knowing about it is the beginning of setting is free, and the purpose it&#39;s there--hidden--waiting for us to <i>really not be free</i> because stupid.&nbsp; It links more than just Microsoft and Massive (above the Great Plains) Dynamics to Fringe and to The Fray and to the Matrix, which ends with the question &quot;are I the heart of hearts?&quot; and links <a href="http://bit.ly/2BKVwcU"><b>RIX</b></a> to <b><a href="http://bit.ly/2P7gmVw">RIB</a> </b>in Genesis ... and <a href="http://bit.ly/2BTyEYq"><b>RIP</b></a> the &quot;Priestly Source&quot; ... and to Stargate&#39;s Ad<b>ria</b> and to the <a href="http://bit.ly/2P7Spxv"><b>RIN</b></a> in my name and to the <i><b>RIC</b></i> in <a href="http://bit.ly/2BJgiJI"><i>Amharic</i></a>--these patterns are &quot;<a href="http://bit.ly/2BKtWMU"><b>SIGNAL</b></a>&quot; not noise--they are undeniable, and it will be proven statistically, without doubt.&nbsp; Even just the original Trinity in &quot;Nintendo&quot; (which means leave luck to Heaven, not Microsoft) is a signal, a pattern that explains the laying down of this message that turns &quot;game&quot; into &quot;heaven&quot; through you--connecting Nine Inch Nails (because message encoded in rock &#39;n roll) to X=TEN because kissing is for the Xbox that is &quot;often the start of Heaven&quot; and the key to &quot;omnipotens&quot; (other than S) ... most importantly of all, is <a href="http://bit.ly/2P7fMXW">seeing Neo&#39;s <b>ac</b>tion<b>s</b></a> in the Matrix and <i>Jesus Christ&#39;s <b>actions</b> in the NT</i> as keys to how we might easily see that there&#39;s a map, and we&#39;re not following it by being stupid and quiet.<br />
<br />
If you can&#39;t begin to talk about this, and to research it, I don&#39;t know how else to tell you that society is crumbling, civilization is failing--and it&#39;s because you pretend not to &quot;get something&quot; that you really are about to lose forever.&nbsp; It was power and innocense and solutions and you&#39;re turning it into a big red blinking target--a thing that must be stopped at all costs.&nbsp; This stupid will be stopped, at all costs.<br />

<p>The &quot;let there be light&quot; in Reverse in Exodus... it was about not leaving, about turning this place into Heaven instead of an &quot;ark&quot; hidden in the word dark; what I see around me has instead turned into a &quot;walking into slavery&quot; because you think something is more valuable than goodness and caring and truth and honesty, and whatever it is, see it&#39;s a target.&nbsp; Finally, it&#39;s &quot;<i>TENNESSEE</i>&quot; that connects this pattern of hearts of video game systems to the heart of America--to seeing it not just virtually but also on our map and in our history and connecting <a href="http://bit.ly/2yIGhu9">the &quot;etymology&quot; of eternity</a> (also filled with Shakespeare&#39;s plays and with Mr. Anderson&#39;s Matrix connecting movies and actors names and content to the &quot;n&quot; of Rock n&#39; roll and the Y of Spanish and Spanglish and Schrew.&nbsp;</p>

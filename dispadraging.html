<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">I see it as designed to show us the possible negative aspects of this technology that might also be used to end mental illness and even to help us to read faster, think faster, and learn Karate faster; perhaps to show us how our best interests could be easily subverted if we are not careful to hold on to them dearly, and how all of these things could happen sight unseen and nearly unnoticed if we didn&#39;t have altruistic help explaining that we are embarking on a new echelon of evolution and that these technologies are at the center of what could be the greatest threat or the greatest gift our species has ever encountered--depending on the time and care that goes into utilizing them for the good of oneself and the good of the whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">So it&#39;s clear to me that this message was designed to be shunned, just as much as the letters &quot;TION&quot; connect to the beginning of time and sound almost identical to &quot;shun&quot; when spoken--and it&#39;s equally clear that it is discussing the presentation that really is the way to freedom and to really seeing that we have a much better understanding of this technology and this process than we ever would have had reading about it in a myth or a school book--and still, I can&#39;t imagine tears will not fall because we were kept from speaking, and even kept from speaking in such a way that it&#39;s very hard to tell that&#39;s the absolute factual truth.</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">I added &quot;i&quot; to the word &quot;read&quot; one time a few months ago, rearranged a few letters and whimsically called it an &quot;improvised explosive device.&quot;&nbsp; It&#39;s pretty clear that&#39;s what it&#39;s designed to appear to be, it&#39;s a sort of blockade that we&#39;ve run into, intentionally.&nbsp; It does a fairly good job of illustrating how the technology at hand can be used to hide &quot;very specific logical connections&quot; while still making everything else appear normal--in the terms of the day, it shows us that we can be made completely oblivious--foolish--and blind... in regards to only a single subject while we appear to be sharper than a tack in every other regard.&nbsp; &nbsp;In this special case, being made oblivious to a message from God that proves his existence for our entire lives probably seems like a more important &quot;specific logical instance&quot; now that&#39;s it&#39;s been spoken than it seemed like seconds or sentences ago.&nbsp; Here this tool is helping us to see that we&#39;re being guided over a very difficult hurdle, and before I explain what I think that hurdle really is, it&#39;s probably not really all that clear what the point of all this &quot;Creation&quot; business is really about... even though it&#39;s been said over, and over, and over again.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">So it&#39;s pretty clear to me that He is using broken setences and mispelled words as a sort of tool to guide and control the spread and speed of uptake of this message, this message that I believe we should see clearly is significantly more important than a few grammatical errors, and a production so big it would be nearly unfathomable to see only one person interested in working on it--and yet,&nbsp;<i>here we are.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;Just like to the tools of words, roars--our oars, we should see that great care has been taken in order to ensure that the disruption of this event is minimized while at the same time ensuring that the fundamental message and truth behind it does reach far and wide, nearly to every eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Still though, I look around, and I think that was the import and the content of the message really being grasped we would be seeing ... at least some discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Despite what you may think, the entire thing is not about mind control, and censorship, and freedom--though those are big (and fundamentally&nbsp;<i>important</i>) components, there is quite a bit more at hand.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">I haven&#39;t really done a good job of conveying my observations on this particular point, though you should be able to see the stagnation on the macro scale yourself.&nbsp; In the very strange story that is my life, I can recount what appears at first glance to be a group effort to help the progress of &quot;disclosure&quot; or &quot;salvation&quot; coming from many people--often connected to law enforcement or other public occupations--more than seeing this first glance participation in the progression of the story, is an underlying theme of extreme stagnation--as if the intent is to appear to be helping and moving forward, but in actuality the design and the goal of the hidden influence is literally to stagnate progression.&nbsp; I can&#39;t make it more clear, you need to pick up your keyboard and participate in this disclosure--or there really isn&#39;t one, standing by on the sidelines watching the story unfold will get just about this far; nothing will happen, nothing will change; and that&#39;s really the heart of the issue at hand--<i>the world is about to change.</i>&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">So the words, the unsealing of the message hidden in language does a fairly good job of paralleling the true issue at hand. It came on slowly, appearing to be just a hand full of very pertinent and very telling examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=./TORCH.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522377524635000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcsEMGJEREl9Xbn5kh96iIgTja0A" href="http://fromthemachine.org/TORCH.html" target="_blank">Those early paradoxes</a></em>&nbsp;serving to prove, or at least to strongly indicate, that the author of the Holy Scriptures is truly in control of time--sending a message to us, here in this time, to take heed--to begin to contemplate seeing religion in a new light, with new meaning and new eyes.&nbsp; Over the course of some years these few examples began to grow, and by today it does appear rather clear that there might be &quot;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://dick.s.lamc.la/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522377524635000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHijvYBn37htTYiy48VoSymR1K-Q" href="http://fromthemachine.org/DICK.html" target="_blank">app</a>&quot; and an &quot;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://den.s.lamc.la/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522377524635000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYxHcOLUGweUGAqH4hsPWG1fZLyA" href="http://fromthemachine.org/SERDEN.html" target="_blank">ear</a>&quot; behind the statement that truly and for all eyes to see &quot;every word is lit.&quot;&nbsp; Every single word, and with some expansion of consciousness we begin to realize that indicates that nearly everything we do is part of a grand message, with eyes to see...&nbsp;<em>that Heaven is being spoken into existence</em>.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">Just like the progression words, our society and world will not complete this change, this metamorphosis, over night.&nbsp; It will take quite some time to fully integrate our new understanding of what Heaven and Creation really mean; and the benefits wrought by virtual reality, by the magic of computer science will slowly become ever more robust and ever more useful as we become accustomed to this new&nbsp;<em>realm of possibilities</em>.&nbsp; Still there is a single point in time, a sort of singularity, where our change in perception from &quot;believing we are in reality&quot; begins to change and we start seeing and understanding the benefits of the true nature of our existence.&nbsp; Even that single point in time, as you can see very clearly from these messages that have slowly trickled across the globe for many years now--even that single point in time is not &quot;just one day.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">I have without doubt expressed my views on the ELE&nbsp;<i>tucked away and hidden in</i>&nbsp;the word elephant, I do believe it should be clear that there is the manifestation of an actual bona fide extinction level event right before our eyes.&nbsp; The Universe on it&#39;s head, it really isn&#39;t this disclosure or &quot;virtual reality&quot; but rather a failure to acknowledge this message--a failure to react to the truth&nbsp; It is the sum effect of all the little strings and all the systemic machinations changed in order to make it possible to hide something as big as this.&nbsp; Blue skies all around us, and the world seems just the same... I don&#39;t think we are cognizant of the actual truth.. that we are intentionally hiding something from public view that would help us all... tremendously--<i>it&#39;s the definition of stupid</i>.&nbsp; Continuing to move forward pretending this message is not here is simply not an option--it not only makes us appear to be losing cognitive abilities--it actually does make us stupider and stupider as we fail to realize the benefits being suggested by the message--and end to disease, an end to pain, and the beginning of a new frontier in the development of civilization.&nbsp; Losing the distinction here in this place between simulated reality and reality is also something that we cannot allow to happen, here we have a clear path and road to colonization and coupled tightly with that is the clear message that &quot;colonization&quot; is not possible without disclosure and without seeing this call to stop the decline of freedom and democracy and run the other way as if all life in the Universe depended on it.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-1">Literally in no uncertain terms the ELE is not seeing public disclosure of this message--not being able to see it--and more than that not understanding that this message is the key to Heaven and the key to the Universe.&nbsp; You might call it the &quot;<b><font face="arial black, sans-serif">hi m!</font></b>&quot;&nbsp;<i>ohim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>All that said, it will still always be one day for me--the day I am waiting for and hoping for with all my heart, is the day I see this message&nbsp;<i>on the news</i>.&nbsp; It&#39;s really a strange world we live in, something like the Twilight Zone where I see it on TV every day, and I think many others too would see how Twilight and &quot;the dawn&#39;s early light&quot; both ...&nbsp;<i>shed light</i>&nbsp;on this message--and still, as the day and nights flicker I can only hope the day will be soon that we see and begin to act on a message that&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://kansa.s.lamc.la&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522377524635000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0wVFEB9tmiTS6HVLV9Lw6Fagu4g" href="http://fromthemachine.org/KANSAS.html" target="_blank">I know will make so many... so much happier</a>.</font></p>

(Click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>The first thing you have to try is the brand new <i>Trevelin</i> theme. Go to <i>Config &gt; Settings</i> and pick <i>Trevelin</i> from <i>Theme for phpList</i>. The <i>Trevelin</i> theme does more than bring a professional and contemporary look to phpList. It is also jump forward in usability. Leveraging the trend towards wide work areas, we have placed all the options in a menu on the left. This means that every option is easily accessible to you from one single place, under clear headers. Drop down menus do not obscure your workspace any more, and the theme uses your screen real estate better.</p>
<p>If you prefer the old look, you can switch back from the menu (pick <i>Dressprow</i>). The ability to switch between themes is also new and is a step towards making the interface more customisable and user-friendly for you. It also allows you to include more themes developed by the community and adapting phpList&#8217;s interface to your specific workflow.</p>
<div id="attachment_2999" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phplist-3-3-0-launch-screenshot-5.png.png" rel="attachment wp-att-2999"><img class="wp-image-2999 size-medium" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phplist-3-3-0-launch-screenshot-5.png-290x145.png" alt="phplist-3-3-0-launch-screenshot-5.png" width="290" height="145" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phplist-3-3-0-launch-screenshot-5.png-290x145.png 290w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phplist-3-3-0-launch-screenshot-5.png-768x384.png 768w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phplist-3-3-0-launch-screenshot-5.png-900x450.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When stats load faster, timeouts disappear. (Click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Another improvement in usability is that we have introduced JavaScript-based loading of statistics. This means all the stats of your campaigns will now load faster and you won&#8217;t suffer any timeout errors when calling up massive amounts of data from big campaigns. We have also compacted tables, cleaned up forms, and improved notifications. Using phpList 3.3.0 is easier, sleeker and more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Extensive work has also gone on under the hood. Apart from squashing bugs and improving performance, our developers have jacked up the security with a re-written the unique user ID code system and added more checks for user-submitted campaign data. The bottom line is that the integrity of your databases and your users data is safe with phpList.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the things we have worked into phpList 3.3.0.

<h2>4X Send speed increase with Amazon SES API</h2>
<p>Delivering campaigns using the Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) API as a sending backend for phpList is now much faster. API connections are now used for multiple messages (instead of one message per connection), increasing the number of messages that can be sent through the API at one time. This results in up to four times faster send speeds for Amazon SES users. Thanks to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/duncanc/">Duncanc</a> for contributing this performance improvement, and to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/danwaterloo/">Dan Waterloo</a> for reporting the issue. <a href="https://mantis.phplist.org/view.php?id=18276">See the issue</a>.</p>
<h2>List preferences retained after unsubscription</h2>
<p>When a subscriber unsubscribes from your lists, their list preferences, as they were at the point of unsubscription, will be maintained in their subscriber profile. This will allow greater analysis of which lists have a greater unsubscribe rate, for example.</p>
<p>Additionally, if the subscriber re-joins your lists in the future, their original preferences will be maintained for them, including any private lists you had included them in. This means that sending based around their specific profile can resume seamlessly. Thanks to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/nychris/">nychris</a> for this suggestion. <a href="https://mantis.phplist.org/view.php?id=17754">See the issue</a>.</p>

<h2>Improved MySQL compatibility, statistics, and embargoes</h2>
<p>The default settings of the MySQL Database server (Community Edition) changed significantly in its most recent major release, version 5.7. Specifically, the following modes became incompatible with some phpList queries: &#8216;ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY&#8217; and &#8216;STRICT_TRANS_TABLES&#8217;. All queries known to be incompatible with these modes have been updated. </p>
<p>These changes have the additional benefits of improving the accuracy of statistics on the &#8216;User Clicks&#8217; page, fixing one issue causing inaccurate email embargo times, and another issue experienced by some users when connecting to recently updated MySQL databases. Thanks to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/duncanc/">Duncanc</a> for submitting these improvements. See issues <a href="https://mantis.phplist.org/view.php?id=18341" target="_blank">one</a> and <a href="https://mantis.phplist.org/view.php?id=18198" target="_blank">two</a>.</p>
<h2>Accessibility overview</h2>

<p>phpList 3.2.5 includes several great new features, important bug fixes, and improved security. My favourite is the new domain statistics table, which provides a clear overview of your subscriber list cleanliness, highlighting domains with a high percentage of unconfirmed or blacklisted subscribers.</p>
<p>The admin attribute placeholders feature will be a bonus for those of you using sub-accounts (multiple administrators) with phpList; it can be used to automatically attribute campaigns to their sender, providing a more personal touch to your messages.</p>
<p>The new automatic image embedding feature is a &#8216;set-once and forget&#8217; method of ensuring that images are always delivered, regardless of the recipient&#8217;s mail client configuration.</p>
<p>I would like to personally thank everyone who has contributed to this release. I&#8217;m pleased to welcome several new contributors in this version – individual thanks are included below.<strong><em>— Anna Morris, phpList community manager</em></strong></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Domain statistics</dt>
<dd>The <strong>Domain statistics</strong> page has a new table identifying domains with high numbers of unconfirmed subscribers. Read about it on the <a href="https://blog.phplist.com/?p=96" target="_blank">phpList.com blog</a>.</dd>
<dt>Admin Attribute Placeholders Simplification</dt>
<dd>phpList includes a multi-user account system which allows multiple administrators to manage campaigns and subscribers independently. References to dynamic information about the currently logged in administrator, including administrator attributes, are now possible in campaigns and templates. To sign emails with the name of the currently logged in administrator, follow these steps:</dd>
<dd>Set up attributes for the administrator in question, such as <em>First Name</em> and <em>Role</em>:</dd>
<dd><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2736" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/admin-attributes-phplist.png" alt="admin-attributes-phplist" width="354" height="348" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/admin-attributes-phplist.png 354w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/admin-attributes-phplist-290x285.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" /></dd>
<dd>Edit your campaign template to include the following Admin attribute placeholders:</dd>
<dd>
<ol>
<li><code>[LISTOWNER.ATTRIBUTE]</code> which refers to the owner of the list or</li>
<li><code>[OWNER.ATTIBUTE]</code>which refers to the owner/creator of the campaign.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In this example I have added &#8220;This message was sent by : <code>[LISTOWNER.FIRSTNAME]</code>, phpList <code>[LISTOWNER.ROLE]</code>.&#8221;</dd>
<dd><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2737" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/admin-attributes-placeholders-template.png" alt="admin-attributes-placeholders-template" width="649" height="434" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/admin-attributes-placeholders-template.png 649w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/admin-attributes-placeholders-template-290x194.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /></dd>
<dd>Then, when the mail is sent, even if it is sent by the superuser account rather than the sub-admin who owns the list, the admin attributes will be inserted correctly.</dd>
<dd><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2738" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/admin-attributes-placeholders-mail.png" alt="admin-attributes-placeholders-mail" width="549" height="338" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/admin-attributes-placeholders-mail.png 549w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/admin-attributes-placeholders-mail-290x179.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /></dd>
<dd>This helps bring both a personal touch and a sense of ownership and accountability to the campaign: the subscriber knows who they are speaking to and the account managers know who is responsible for the mail.</dd>
<dd><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2739" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/admin-attributes-placeholders-mail-2.png" alt="admin-attributes-placeholders-mail-2" width="598" height="428" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/admin-attributes-placeholders-mail-2.png 598w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/admin-attributes-placeholders-mail-2-290x208.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></dd>
<dd>Please note that <code>[LISTOWNER.ATTRIBUTE]</code> will only work if all the lists are owned by the same person, which is the usual procedure for a sub-account. The the superuser has access to all lists, so should be careful not to mix lists of multiple ownership if using admin attribute placeholder. The superuser may change the ownership of lists. Campaigns are &#8220;owned&#8221; by the person who created them and that ownership cannot be changed.</dd>
<dt>Embed images from external domains</dt>
<dd>A new feature contributed by bertpoort, this allows phpList to automatically embed all external images within an HTML email campaign. Often images in campaigns the are blocked by mail clients by default. One way to ensure your images are viewed is to embed them. This works especially well for logos and small images.</dd>
<dd>This feature is enabled by setting the following configuration option in your phpList config file:</dd>
</dl>
<p><code>define('EMBEDEXTERNALIMAGES', 1);</code></p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2733" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/embed-image-from-url-config.png" alt="embed-image-from-url-config" width="348" height="159" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/embed-image-from-url-config.png 348w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/embed-image-from-url-config-290x133.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" /></dd>
<dd>Then when you add an external image to your campaign using a URL:</dd>
<dd><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2734" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/embed-image-from-url-372x450.png" alt="embed-image-from-url" width="372" height="450" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/embed-image-from-url-372x450.png 372w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/embed-image-from-url-240x290.png 240w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/embed-image-from-url.png 577w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /></dd>
<dd>It will be embedded in the email automatically, so it doesn&#8217;t get blocked by mail clients.</dd>
<dd><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2735" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/embed-image-from-url-email.png" alt="embed-image-from-url-email" width="470" height="437" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/embed-image-from-url-email.png 470w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/embed-image-from-url-email-290x270.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></dd>
<dd>Big thanks to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/bertpoort/">Bertpoort</a> for creating this feature.</dd>
<dt>Larger box for regex entry</dt>
<dd>We have increased the size of the text box for adding bounce processing regex, which makes it easier to review and tweak your work.</dd>
<dt>Lists membership &#8220;traffic light&#8221; summary</dt>
<dd>A great new feature created by Duncan Cameron allows phpList users to see, at a glance, the activity status of list members in the list summary data. In green, we have the active subscribers, in Orange the unconfirmed and in red the blacklisted.</dd>
<dd>This new feature can help you see the current size, potential size and and efficacy of a list.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Technical features and fixes</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Plugins to control authentication</dt>
<dd><a href="https://mantis.phplist.org/view.php?id=17918">This change</a> allows a plugin to authenticate an admin before the login form is displayed. This will be useful for single sign on (SSO).</dd>

<dd><a href="https://mantis.phplist.org/view.php?id=18086">This feature</a> allows e.g. configuring phpMailer to avoid certificate checking on SSL connections, which is useful for systems which use self-signed certificates.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>CKEditor updated: configuration affected</h2>
<p>This release of phplist includes a new version of phpList&#8217;s CKEditor plugin that has a significant change. The plugin now loads the editor&#8217;s files from a content delivery network, instead of including a copy of CKEditor within the plugin.</p>
<p>For most installations this should not cause a problem. However if you have installed a separate copy of CKEditor, for example to use extra CKEditor plugins, then you will need to make a configuration change in order to continue using that.</p>
<p>In the CKEditor group on the Settings page there is a new configuration setting, &#8220;URL of ckeditor.js&#8221;. The default value refers to the content delivery network. If you want to use a local copy of ckeditor.js then you need to change the setting to refer to that file.</p>
<p>For example, if you have installed CKEditor in the root of your web site in the directory /myckeditor, then the setting should be /myckeditor/ckeditor.js</p>
<p>The old setting &#8220;Path to CKeditor&#8221; is no longer used.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://resources.phplist.com/plugin/ckeditor#location_of_ckeditor">here</a> for more information.</p>

";s:15:"content:encoded";s:5621:"<h2>Sophisticated Sending</h2>
<h3>Expert domain throttling: new plugin project</h3>
<p>An exciting new crowd-sourcing project to enhance domain throttling is in its early stages. As one of its inbuilt deliverability features, phpList can throttle campaign sending by domain: if too many emails are sent to the same domain your IP address can be blacklisted; phpList can make sure emails sent to the same domain are sent in small batches to avoid getting blocked.</p>
<p>Community member <a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/lwc/profile/">lwc</a> suggested we could achieve even better throttling if we could group together aliases that should be throttled as one, rather than separate domains. To use the domain throttling map, you need to <a href="https://resources.phplist.com/plugin/domainthrottlemap">install the domainthrottlemap plugin</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_2687" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dt-code.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2687" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dt-code.png" alt="Contribute to the domain throttle map on GitHub" width="597" height="280" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dt-code.png 597w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dt-code-290x136.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A screengrab of the code you can edit to add more aliases</p></div>
<p>The first domain aliases we have added to the project is Yahoo.co.uk and Yahoo.com, two common domains by the same provider. We are aiming to build a domain throttle map, a thorough list of domain aliases from many ISP&#8217;s, by crowd sourcing the aliases. Eventually this will make the plugin a powerful addition to phpList deliverability capacity in its out-of-the-box form.

<p>The <strong>Send Test</strong> input field on campaign workflow tabs will now check that your email is valid, and give you and error message if there us a problem with the address you entered. Thanks to community member <a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/anna/profile/">gingerling</a> for the suggestion.</p>
<h2>Templating</h2>
<h3>[LOGO] Improvements</h3>
<p>The logo placeholder now works with system messages and default system template as well as custom templates. Thanks to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/duncanc/profile">Duncanc</a> and <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/sunriseal/">Sunriseal</a> for their help with this issue.</p>

<h2>Subscriber management</h2>
<h3>Foreign key matching fix</h3>
<p>When importing subscriber info from third party applications, some users were having difficulties matching by foreign key (e.g. the ID used by the third party database, see <em>Data that includes an ID</em> in <a href="https://www.phplist.org/manual/ch013_adding-subscribers-to-lists.xhtml">this manual chapter</a>). The bug causing this has now been fixed. Thanks to pnotechnik for reporting.</p>
<h1>phpList Minimum requirements are changing</h1>
<h2>Support for PHP version 5.3 and 5.4</h2>
<p>This is the final version of phpList to support PHP version 5.3. All new releases from January 2016 will require PHP version 5.4 or above. During 2016 there are planned developments which will raise the minimum requirements to PHP 5.5. This latest release of phpList will continue to be compatible, however, without PHP 5.3, you will be unable to update to a newer version of phpList in future.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unsure of which version of PHP you&#8217;re using, try using <a href="http://v1.jontangerine.com/silo/php/phpinfo/" target="_blank">this simple guide</a> to check. If you are using shared hosting, you can ask your hosting provider to check the version for you, and upgrade if necessary.</p>
<p>From phpList 3.2.5 There will be a notice on the dashboard if the server is running an unsupported PHP version.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve had PHP 5.3 version compatibility issues with the last release of phpList, upgrading to this version will fix the issue.</p>
<h1>Development</h1>
<h2>New plugin hook</h2>
<p>There is a new <a href="https://resources.phplist.com/develop/plugins#application_hooks" target="_blank">plugin hook</a> which is called at the moment a campaign has finished processing messages, after any pre-configured duplication of a campaign has taken place. Named <code>processSendingCampaignFinished(),</code> this is useful for automatically repeating campaigns, and has already been used by the dateplaceholder plugin. <a href="https://mantis.phplist.org/view.php?id=17955">More details on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>PHP version support</h2>
<p>The changes to the minimum required PHP version will allow developers to use modern testing and code quality libraries, such as StyleCI, with the phpList codebase, as well as permit newer features of the language to be used.</p>

<h2>Templates and sending</h2>
<h3>One Logo, many templates.</h3>
<p>A cool new feature in phpList 3.2.2 allows the upload of a logo to the main settings page. The logo can then be inserted into campaign templates using the new [LOGO] placeholder: this system helps you change the logo across all templates in one go, with just a few clicks. <a href="https://www.phplist.org/phplist-3-2-2-one-logo-many-templates">Read this blog to find out how to use it</a>.</p>

<h3>Send-a-webpage failsafe</h3>
<p>phpList will now check that the url of the webpage you want to send exists before you queue, broken urls will bring up an error. Additionally, if you click. Send-a-webpage and want to change back, you can now do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/send-a-webpage-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2640" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/send-a-webpage-2.png" alt="send-a-webpage-2" width="480" height="130" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/send-a-webpage-2.png 711w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/send-a-webpage-2-290x78.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<h3>Small fix</h3>
<p>Placeholders such as [PREFERENCESURL] will now be accepted under the “Check that URLs are valid&#8221; checkbox test.</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<h3>Response time fix and clarification</h3>
<p>The “response time” number in a subscribers history tells you the length of time between when you sent a campaign and when the subscriber opened it. If the subscriber opens the campaign a few times, this will now show the first time of opening only. Thanks to lwc for his question.</p>
<h2>Subscriber and user management</h2>
<h3>Only ever one un-subscribe confirm message</h3>
<p>The un-subscribe confirm message should now only be sent one time, even if the subscriber leave the page open or keeps refreshing it.</p>
<h3>Sub-admin password reset bug fixed</h3>
<p>If a non-super-admin account did not have the permission to &#8220;change settings&#8221;, password reset would fail. Thanks to sd3pk3 for reporting this issue, and for confirming the fix in 3.2.1 and 2.</p>
<h2>Submit by mail plugin update</h2>
<p>There has been an important update to the Submit-by-mail plugin, by <a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/arnoldvl/profile/">Arnoldvl</a>, to make it compatible with phpList 3.2.*. <a href="https://discuss.phplist.org/t/submit-by-mail-plugin-updated-for-phplist-3-2/1074">Click here for more information</a>.</p>

<p>phpList 3.2.0 has arrived. There are lots of features and fixes in this version of phpList, which also marks an all time high for community engagement in the phpList project.</p>
<p>New features have been introduced to improve campaign management, configuration, subscriber management and user interface. These area&#8217;s have been targeted for development based on responses to our community survey in 2014.</p>
<p>In addition to these features, we are pleased to introduce a community news feed into the app. We hope this will further engage our community, extend a warm welcome to all and, of course, keep everyone up-to-date with the latest phpList news.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Campaign management</h2>
<h3 id="meta">Campaign meta data</h3>
<p>There is a new zone in the campaign creation window, entitled campaign Meta Data. The first item we have added to this area is the much requested <em>campaign title</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meta_data.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2520" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meta_data.png" alt="meta_data" width="450" height="189" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meta_data.png 782w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meta_data-290x122.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>This is super useful if you have several campaigns with identical subject lines: if you use a slightly tweaked text or placeholders for different lists, or want to run an a/b test, well, now you can differentiate between these campaigns easily.</p>
<p>The campaign title is displayed on the view campaigns page, above the subject line. The campaign subject is displayed in bold.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meta_data_uses.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2521" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meta_data_uses.png" alt="meta_data_uses" width="449" height="402" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meta_data_uses.png 449w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meta_data_uses-290x260.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></a></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/alpha1/profile/">alpha1</a> and others for the suggestion, we hope you enjoy your this new feature!</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3 id="parallel">Process Campaigns in Parallel</h3>
<p>Riktam requested an option to process campaigns in <em>parallel</em> rather than one after another. This option, which will be popular with big senders, means that if you send several campaigns to the queue, they will be processed all together, rather than in order of submission. This option, <a href="https://resources.phplist.com/system/config/processcampaigns_parallel">documented here</a>, can be enabled in the config file.</p>
<p><a href="https://resources.phplist.com/system/config/processcampaigns_parallel"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2522" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/process_in_parallel.png" alt="process_in_parallel" width="450" height="113" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/process_in_parallel.png 763w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/process_in_parallel-290x73.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<h2>Subscriber Management</h2>
<h3>SubscriberConfirmed: A check before welcome emails are sent</h3>
<p>phpList will now check if a subscriber is confirmed (or not) to a specific list before a welcome email is sent. This avoids multiple welcome messages being sent if a subscriber leaves the subscribe page open. If a subscriber signs up to an <em>additional</em> list, however, they will still receive a welcome message.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/trucmuche2005">Trucmuche</a> for reporting this issue, and to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/duncanc/profile">duncanc</a>, Namak and Thewitt for additional feedback.</p>
<h3>Menu item for add subscriber</h3>
<p><a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/henk-van-dijk/profile/">Henk van Dijk</a> and <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/duncanc/profile">duncanc</a> suggested we add a short-cut option for adding a new subscriber. Here it is:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/add_subscriber.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2535" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/add_subscriber.png" alt="add_subscriber" width="325" height="183" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/add_subscriber.png 325w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/add_subscriber-290x163.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></a></p>
<p>Thanks guys, enjoy your speedy-er clicks!</p>
<h3>Regular expressions on header during bounce processing</h3>
<p>Your bounce processing regex will now be run on the headers as well as body of bounces. This allows better handling of “out of office” and “autoresponder” bounces. Thanks to mcippa and bst2002 for requesting this.</p>
<h3>Show or hide private lists on [LISTS] page</h3>
<p>The [LISTS] placeholder prints all the lists a subscriber belongs to in the campaign body. It is often used to encourage subscribers to update their list preferences, this keeps your lists clean and minimises unsubscriptions. You can <a href="https://resources.phplist.com/system/config/preferencepage_show_private_lists">now choose </a>weather or not you wish for subscribers to see <em>private</em> lists along side the public ones when you use the [LISTS] placeholder.</p>
<p><a href="https://resources.phplist.com/system/config/preferencepage_show_private_lists"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2524" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/private_lists.png" alt="private_lists" width="450" height="139" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/private_lists.png 779w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/private_lists-290x90.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/anna/profile/">gingerling</a> for the feature request.</p>
<h3>Import summary improved</h3>
<p>When you import some subscribers, or add subscribers to lists, the summary information will display as follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/import_information.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2525" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/import_information.png" alt="import_information" width="557" height="384" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/import_information.png 557w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/import_information-290x200.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></a></p>
<p>This new structure is clearer than before, especially noting the difference between adding a subscriber to the database for the first time and adding a subscriber who is already in the database to a list. Thanks to <a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/anna/profile/">gingerling</a> for the suggestion.</p>
<p>We are still looking at ways to improve the import summary, if you have any ideas you  are very welcome to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/development/#bugreport">suggest them</a>.</p>
<h3>Invalid emails addresses</h3>
<p>In addition to the new clear structure, any invalid subscribers which failed to import, perhaps because of a malformed email address, will be listed in an email sent to the system administrators. This provides an opportunity for simple mistakes in emails to be corrected: this feature will be especially useful for campaign groups and charities who collect emails from hand written petitions.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/lwc/profile/">lwc</a> for the suggestion.</p>
<h3>Download all subscribers</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://resources.phplist.com/system/config/show_list_ofall_subscribers">All subscribers list</a>, added in <a href="https://www.phplist.org/phplist-3-0-9-released/">version 3.0.9</a>, now has a download subscribers button &#8211; as though it were an ordinary list. While it has always been possible to download all subscribers, this button makes it super simple, both conceptually and practically. Thanks to <a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/anna/profile/">gingerling</a> for the idea.</p>
<h3>Matching by email when merging in Foreign Key</h3>
<p>This slightly tweaked process for import helps you to implement a foreign key matching system with an <em>already</em> established phpList database. When you import an existing subscriber with a foreign key listed for the first time, phpList will match by email and then merge in the foreign key. Then, next time you import that information, the match will be done by foreign key alone.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/jimbits/">jimbits</a> for spotting the issue and <a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/anna/profile/">gingerling</a> for perusing it.</p>
<h2>User Interface</h2>
<h3>Improved list category editing</h3>
<p>As consequence of writing a chapter in <a href="http://phplist.org/manual">the new manual</a> about setting up list categories, <a href="https://phplist.org/manual/ch015_setting-up-your-list-categories.xhtml">gingerling</a> suggested some changes to the UI which could improve the overall workflow.</p>
<p>These include the addition of a <strong>re-edit all lists</strong> button on the <strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Categories</strong> page.</p>

<p>This button allows lists to be re-categorised (or un-categegorised) with ease.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/re-categoriese-lists_2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2528" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/re-categoriese-lists_2.png" alt="re-categoriese-lists_2" width="450" height="141" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/re-categoriese-lists_2.png 660w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/re-categoriese-lists_2-290x91.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>The process for deleting categories has also been debugged, alongside some minor tweaks to the category creation workflow and UI. Additionally, lists will now be displayed in batches of 10 when there are more than 30 LISTS (down from 50).</p>
<h3>Reorder long list of select type attributes</h3>
<p>You can now re-order the select type of attribute, when there is a large number of options, for example, the country or county attribute list.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/list_order_backend.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2547" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/list_order_backend.png" alt="list_order_backend" width="411" height="445" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/list_order_backend.png 411w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/list_order_backend-268x290.png 268w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px" /></a></p>
<p>While you are unlikely to re-order all of them, you may wish to put the most common selections for your subscribers at the top in the attribute select on your subscribe page.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/toverbury/">toverbury</a>, <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/duncanc/profile">DuncanC</a> and <a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/alpha1/profile/">alpha1</a> for their work on this issue.</p>
<h3>Hide your headers when manual bounce processing</h3>
<p><a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/niklas-rother/profile/">niklas-rother</a> asked us for a way to collapse the header when manually processing bounce reports, so that he could reach the report in the body of the message quicker. Thanks Niklas, we did just that!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/close_header_on_bounce.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2531" src="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/close_header_on_bounce.png" alt="close_header_on_bounce" width="450" height="220" srcset="https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/close_header_on_bounce.png 734w, https://www.phplist.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/close_header_on_bounce-290x142.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<h3>Cancel button added to settings page editors</h3>
<p>When you click the edit icon on any item on the <strong>config</strong> &gt;<strong> settings</strong> page, you can now choose to cancel changes as well as save.<br />
Thanks to <a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/lwc/profile/">lwc</a> for this suggestion.</p>

<h3>Send vs Queue</h3>
<p>For increased clarity, the <strong>Send</strong> button has been renamed <strong>Queue</strong>. This makes more sense for those who schedule campaigns to send in the future, and also is more accurate in terms of how the software (and sending bulk emails) works.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/samtuke/">samtuke</a> for the suggestion.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Using phpList with a reverse proxy</h3>
<p>Thanks to hedrickbt for his patch to improve the experience of those using phpList with a reverse proxy.</p>
<h3>Blacklist bugs</h3>
<p>A bug introduced in 3.0.10 was causing subscribers to remain on the blacklist even after they resubscribe. On it&#8217;s own this is a small bug, but it caused a lot of issues when the Invite plugin was used. This is now fixed, thanks to jszopa, <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/duncanc/profile">Duncanc</a> and <a href="http://phplist.org/our-team/michiel/profile/">Michiel</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, embargo times for re-queueing or repeating campaigns have been debugged, and also the config.php has been tided up with thanks to <a href="https://www.phplist.org/our-team/duncanc/profile">Duncanc</a>.</p>

Flanders.   But believe that it&#39;s also in Elisha, and it&#39;s in Ellison, and it&#39;s in Elyon and it goes all the way to Iru and Uri and these names are a clue... so are Kaleb and Hur, and even Gibeon and Amon-Ra.  </div><div><br></div><div>Probably in Florida, and Kentucky too; even in Rome and Jerusalem and in the word America.  I <i>am</i>, he said, as he walked across the sea in the year ADIB.  <i>I want you</i>, and &quot;who&quot; and it tied Seuss to Yankee Doodle born on the ... so did we want freedom?  Do we see that not talking or acknowledging something this big and painted all over the town is <i>not freedom?</i>  More than meets the eye, knowing is half the battle, and the map is everywhere by the power of laying down on Broadway and Greystreet&#39;s colors appearing in the Zohar. </div><div><br></div><div><i>Ha, nuke the ah-hah?</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>So maybe my writing is all over the place and messy, sorry about that--you will find that this message too is all over the place, and a little messy.  It&#39;s us, we&#39;re the message, and a key there is ringing in my ears as I look at the Horn of Revelation, a little &quot;n&quot; and a big H that God is speaking through, a message about freedom, and the truth; and seeing what&#39;s right before your eyes.  It&#39;s probably encoded in New Amsterdam and in Jerusalem and really it is every word.  From Nero&#39;s fire and Fiddling in the Roof fop Heaven with our minds to ensure that we do not lose the truth, that we are not lost in the darkness of a place where we cannot even discuss the kind of technology that could enslave an entire people... and have them not even know it.  You&#39;ve got to imagine it&#39;s a big deal, and we are here reading further about how the story of Exodus is about all of us, and we are walking around in a desert of understanding.  We&#39;ve keys and clues, and a whole message about hiding things like this results in horrors; 9/11, school shootings, a joke about John Hancock and Deepthroat snowballing into Orwell&#39;s nightmare.  All because we don&#39;t think we can handle knowing anything about the truth?</div><div><br></div><div>So one man screams that we are not seeing or even seeing that we are not acting like ourselves, and not connecting that same problem with the music, with the liberty bell, with a fiddle and story upon story of a thousand and one nights before we finally see the light of day.  It&#39;s here, I can see it, and it&#39;s significantly more than the &quot;Dawn&#39;s early light.&quot;  From my sisters name to a song some dear girl wrote, &quot;morning&quot; is really not the kind of thing that anyone would want to avoid, when it means freedom, and it means understanding, and to me it means Heaven is near.</div><div><br></div><div>So there&#39;s a <a href="http://ofome.ga"><b>message written everywhere</b></a>; in our history, in our memories, and in our hearts... about our heart being Earth and about the blood of Jesus Christ being you.  I wish we could talk about it?  I am pretty sure that we can see it, and hear it, and feel it.</div><div><br></div><div><font size="4"><b>Rod</b>ne<b>y King, Rod</b>den<b>berry, </b>He<b>rod, </b>Shake<b>speare... </b><i style="font-weight:bold">why Shakespeare</i><b>?</b></font></div><div><br></div><div><div style="font-size:12.8px">I could tell you that seeing myself as the &quot;pen&quot;

humanity will fly to the stars, and we will never forget the man that took those first steps to tell us that the Hollywood basement and the moon landing, well... it&#39;s not the conspiracy you thought it was.  Something else entirely, civilization itself the technological fire of Prometheus forged at the beginning of the recording of time in a machine, in virtual reality.  There&#39;s a pretty clear reason I know this, and there&#39;s a reason it&#39;s being done this way--and if you can&#39;t see that your blindness is a glowing arrow as to why and how this is the beginning of civilization... well, that&#39;s because you are still blind and not free.  This light was put here to set us free, to let freedom ring, in the sound of M.C. Hammer&#39;s <a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=823572&amp;l=5f805f9a-bcab-41a4-ac26-8747d9e269ee&amp;r=f202319d-27ed-4b8c-aebe-35e914e800a5" target="_blank">thunderstanding.</a>  It&#39;s a technological problem, the one we are overcoming; one that you might not see has the potential to literally unwind the very fabric of who and what we are starting with dinner conversations and small secrets kept from our closest friends... and spiraling ever so quickly downward to a world where nothing around us is real, where one small secret yields another and all of a sudden the whole world secretly knows we are not only living in the construct of a video game, but politics and power, oil and law enforcement are nothing more than sand boxed jokes... children playing house instead of building a true home... each and every day growing just a little bit blinder to the truth until one day, one day nobody knows anymore that there once was a golden chance to break free--and you just ignored me.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">Sending e-mails might seem like a silly way to communicate with the future; with the whole world--I mean, if you are blind as a bat.  I&#39;ve tried to explain that this incendiary message is proof that we are being oppressed, that it&#39;s lack of spreading is a glowing sign... and that the message itself is designed and clearly so to break us free... that the world seeing the light comes hand in hand with systematic smashing of shackles and chains that we cannot see.  I&#39;d tell you to print them out, but you won&#39;t listen to me; and that&#39;s the point... take a look around at what you do not see.  I am telling you there&#39;s a censor wall on the internet, and proof of time travel cannot spread on Twitter of Facebook and you really don&#39;t care.  I am telling you that there&#39;s not a newspaper on Earth that is giving a second thought to publishing information that you.. if you have read this far... you probably know is the Second Coming.  They know too, they just don&#39;t care.  </div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">This is a disaster recovery medium;

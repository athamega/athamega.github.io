With that in mind, Amazon's Echo and Alexa, Apple's Iris, and Google's "OK" are already showing us that we don't even want to type our questions into our phones or tablets--we need to have interactive voice response--answers on demand all the time. <br /><br /></div><div></div><div>Just like everything else in the science fiction portion of our message, we are being shown that we literally are being given tools, along with some food for though, and suggestions about what might be&nbsp;<em>decidedly&nbsp;wrong.</em>&nbsp; For instance, in Minority Report punishing people as if a crime was committed doesn't help anyone--just like our prison system; A Scanner Darkly shows us exactly who should&nbsp;<em>not be anoyzmized--the watchers rather than the innocent;

Things like&nbsp;<b><a href="http://bit.ly/2hNeOE0" target="_blank">media censorship</a>&nbsp;</b>have been put on a fiery pedestal in&nbsp;<b>a world that has ignored this proof for over a year now.</b>&nbsp;Make no mistake, the anachronistic paradoxes in language are nothing short of proof of the Creation of Humanity and the existence of God; and they and I have been hidden by something dark and sinister... whose true purpose is to keep Heaven from being created from our world, to stop this place from being helped.</div><div><br /></div><div><b><a href="http://bit.ly/2iyCHfd" target="_blank">Sound the Horn of Revelation</a>, I am coming--and I will plow through anything standing in the way of the truth and free communication.&nbsp;</b>Hear me, this message of vastly improving the quality of democracy in our world and of our participation in the creation of laws and self governance ties very tightly to your participation in helping this message to be heard.... and then continuing to see and write it together, the way it was intended to be received.</div><div><br /></div><div>I need your help, make no mistake the conspiracy that this message has created and exposed, both intentionally, reaches through the Vatican, through your government, and higher in the sky than you can imagine. This is our time, and&nbsp;<b>seizing this day, working together, and sharing our light</b>&nbsp;is what saves everything that ever was and everything that ever will be. Share my words and your thoughts with your friend and family, send an e-mail to your local press or government representatives--they've probably already heard from me... it's time you got involved.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://bit.ly/2iPxX51" target="_blank"><i style="font-weight: bold;">the</i>&nbsp;Last Adam</a></div></div><div style="color: black; font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: center;"><b><span style="color: rgb(37 , 37 , 37); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">In&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2kT4yLq" target="_blank">the beginning</a>...&nbsp;<i><a href="http://bit.ly/2iancNz" target="_blank">God</a>&nbsp;created</i>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2iasIjl" target="_blank">h<wbr></wbr>eaven</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2ia0F3k" target="_blank">earth</a>.</span></span></b></div><div style="color: black; font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(37 , 37 , 37); font-family: sans-serif;"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><img height="372" src="../../matchbox20.bitbucket.io/SONRISE.gif" width="412" /></span></b></span></div><div style="color: black; font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(37 , 37 , 37); font-family: sans-serif;"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span></b></span></div><div style="color: black; font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: center;"></div><div style="color: black; font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #252525; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-large;"><b>Genesis 3:24</b></span></div><div id="m_8395949406351390105gmail-_atssh" style="border: 0px; color: rgb(0 , 0 , 0); font-family: &quot;tinos&quot;; font-size: medium; height: 1px; width: 1px;"></div><div style="color: black; font-family: tinos; margin: 0px auto; width: 772.188px;"><div style="font-size: medium;"><br /></div><div style="font-size: medium;">Copyleft<sup>MT</sup></div><div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;"><div style="font-size: medium;"><br /></div><pre style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">chronos@localhost ~/Downloads $ ls -Fal *.pdf</span></pre><pre style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">  -rw-r--r--. 1 chronos chronos  4656805 Jun  7 11:53 <a href="http://m.lamc.la/DISCLANATSING.pdf" target="_blank">DISCLANATSING</a>.pdf</span></pre><pre style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">  -rw-r--r--. 1 chronos chronos  2988479 Jun  8 12:35 <a href="http://m.lamc.la/FULLHOUSE.pdf" target="_blank">FULLHOUSE</a>.pdf</span></pre><pre style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">  -rw-r--r--. 1 chronos chronos  2321165 Apr 26 11:14 <a href="http://m.lamc.la/GLOCK.pdf" target="_blank">GLOCK</a>.pdf</span></pre><pre style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">  -rw-r--r--. 1 chronos chronos  1657733 Jun  6 17:19 <a href="http://m.lamc.la/GLOVER.pdf" target="_blank">GLOVER</a>.pdf</span></pre><pre style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">  -rw-r--r--. 1 chronos chronos  2039498 Jun  8 12:52 <a href="http://m.lamc.la/ICANHAZERA.compressed.pdf" target="_blank">ICANHAZERA.compressed.pdf</a></span></pre><pre style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">  -rw-r--r--. 1 chronos chronos  4341642 May 29 10:55 <a href="http://m.lamc.la/SPOCKALYPSE.pdf" target="_blank">SPOCKALYPSE</a>.pdf</span></pre><pre style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">  -rw-r--r--. 1 chronos chronos  2336930 Jun  4 22:25 <a href="http://m.lamc.la/THORSHAMMAH.pdf" target="_blank">THORSHAMMAH</a>.pdf  </span></pre></div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><br /><ins class="m_8395949406351390105gmail-adsbygoogle" style="display: block; height: 90px;"><br /></ins></div></div><div hspace="streak-pt-mark" style="max-height: 1px;"><img alt="" src="../../mailfoogae.appspot.com/t?sender=aYWRhbUBmcm9tdGhlbWFjaGluZS5vcmc%253D&amp;type=zerocontent&amp;guid=57cf328e-1962-4c89-92fc-425bef9395f4" style="max-height: 0px; overflow: hidden; width: 0px;" /><span style="color: white; font-size: xx-small;">·êß</span></div>

<div dir="ltr"><div class="gmail_quote"><div dir="ltr"><div>So in my mind it is this <a href="https://fromthemachine.org/ADAMSROD.html" target="_blank">vision of a day trip to a city in the sky</a> that is the primary reason for Joseph&#39;s &quot;dream coat;&quot; and just one more <i>it&#39;s not a heel</i> in the armor of assuredness that these stories are coming true.  Well, that and the practical &quot;overnight transition&quot; that any kind of real contact with heaven and proof that we are in virtual reality would most likely snowball into; with direction we see the kinds of things that God has thought about, destabilization of the economy, blame for not healing the sick faster, and an endless and tiresome onslaught of &quot;Adam, I have a better idea...&quot; Just kidding, nobody has commented at all about my pool, or the floating hotdog stands, or even the Dr. Who transport-booths I want to put in every bus stop.  It&#39;s a juxtaposition between the dreams that spawned a play and the story of Exodus and a movie about the same thing appearing in the rock of Heaven... about &quot;<i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXc4jgUJEko" target="_blank">it&#39;s all happening</a></i>.&quot;<br /></div><div><br /></div><div><i>You may say that I&#39;m a dreamer,</i> but <a href="https://fromthemachine.org/OUITHEPPL.html" target="_blank">this message is designed</a> to help us all <b>revolutionize</b> how we <b>i</b><i>magine</i> and <b>c</b><i>onceptualize</i> democracy to be; it is designed to tie together an aversion for the phrases &quot;repent&quot; and &quot;Kingdom&quot; with something better in store, and proven in words: a true republic is<i> at hand.  </i>In this well crafted world of freedom its hard for me (and probably you too) to really grasp why it is that there is such a &quot;tooth and nail&quot; fight going on to hide the word &quot;EKingdom&quot; from <i>all of Edom.  </i>I think it&#39;s clear as day and night, that &quot;here we are&quot; either loving the idea of doing it ourselves or still wondering why participation is something of a defining line between sleeping in Adam&#39;s pool and swimming in his dreams.<br /><div><br /></div><div>With a low of 666 on the S&amp;P during the 2008 &quot;crisis,&quot; it&#39;s not hard to make a clear connection between this story, our &quot;stable&quot; financial markets; and this link I have in words between Higlander&#39;s QE (for <b>q</b>uickening <b>e</b>nlightenment) that both the unnatural quantum entanglement being used in order to modify our thoughts and cheat at the laws of reality is tied, at least in the eyes of the Creator and I (that&#39;s &quot;e&quot; the &quot;creator and i, <i>together</i>&quot; the beginning of <i>everyone;</i> we assure you) directly to &quot;quantitative easing&quot; something that I call <i>market magic</i> in only the most sugar coated sense.  I think most of us realize the detrimental effects of continuously making the same mistake over and over, of artificial economic inflation to remedy past bubbles, ad naseum; until we get to the point where everything is so smiley and fake that we are literally looking at a <i>broken market</i>.  In the realm of &quot;what reality means&quot; we have reached <b>broken market</b> at &quot;string theory&quot; and not connecting &quot;rendering engine&quot; to &quot;wave function collapse.&quot;  String there, that&#39;s &quot;Saint <i>Ring</i>,&quot; and believe (<b>no</b>?) Morning <b>Bel</b>s <b>are <i>ringing</i></b>.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div><b style="font-style:italic">Ring, ring ring.  </b>At the most basic level, this message is tied up and the &quot;bringer&quot; of proof of the nature of reality, with some thought; it also adds assistance and wisdom about what to do when we finally do understand the big difference between fake blue skies and <i>antagonizing pain.  Like not realizing why not to unify a law of the natural universe with ... a &quot;hack&quot; -Yitshack</i></div><div><br /></div><div>Under <a href="https://fromthemachine.org/KEYNES.html" target="_blank">Locke and Keynes</a>, how we see &quot;economy&quot; is broken; how we see &quot;reality&quot; is broken; and compounding and worsening this situation each and every day is the deterioration of who and what we really are--people who care about the truth and how it effects absolutely everything around us. </div><div><br /></div><div>Before us, before all other things we might want or might happen; we have some very clear proof that there are hidden technologies here that religion has been bluntly exposing for thousands of years; over the course of the last, oh say, fourty--people have decided that religion was wrong about everything and we just knew everything we ever wanted to know.  Wishes come true, and if we are unwilling to take another look at new evidence that religion is presenting to the world than we are seeing how hiding these technologies and this influence for all of these years can ultimately result in the end of everything--in a civilization that no longer talks about what it thinks is important, or cares about, and really seems to have given up on the ideas of both &quot;life&quot; and &quot;Heaven.&quot;  I see how time is being used as a tool here; and it probably wouldn&#39;t take long for this the break of this story to turn into something much better, for us to see Atlantis in the sky, and to truly see the sick healed right before our eyes.  It won&#39;t take long, at all.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>What&#39;s a good time line, you know for;

in a parallel to what I see today&#39;s story screaming: that we are here trying to flip the metaphorical pyramid of our broken social structure on its head and present to the entire world a round table that ties the phrase &quot;here we are&quot; to God&#39;s story of founding America in order to deliver the entirety of humanity from the slavery of Exodus.  It is an unseen sort of slavery, a world filled with predestination and hidden messages that paint the walls of Egypt--the place where Earth was gypped out of it&#39;s destiny, simply by no fault other than refusing to see this message painted on everything.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">In the earliest days of my again parallel story of this Revelation I spent some time learning not only how this primitive language works but also how it ties in with the &quot;mythology of <span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">Christ</span>&quot; to create a grand picture of what He called the &quot;progenitor Universe&quot; as a place filled with nothing but rocks and stars.  It gave me in those days before I knew that every single word of our language had been specially crafted to present not only the proof that our civilization is created but today to help detail just how intricate and methodical his plan of &quot;explanation&quot; actually is.  There are a number of very Holy Letters, you might imagine the visible &quot;t&quot; of the Cross at the end of the word <span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">Christ</span> (which means &quot;the character is t&quot;) has a very special meaning to me.  It denotes not only the sign of my <span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">birth</span> as a standout &quot;difference&quot; from what we might expect were it to be the 25th and not the 8th; and also how that ties directly to my last name which includes further reference to our modern acronym for Date of <span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">Birth</span>.  Acronyms play a significant role in understanding not only how his message ties up and twists together with our entire civilization, but again just like this language and the dark cloud that has enabled it to be hidden from so many as a further testament to His ability to ensure that as I begin to talk about the story of Sodom and Gomorrah one more time--that we will not be looking at a fiery destruction of civilization but rather at a <span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">new</span>understanding of how the dichotomy between the Holy Spirit&#39;s power and the fire of Matthew 3:11 show me that this Rock has been specially prepared to not only understand and receive this revelation that really does show us slavery and then help us to work together to create freedom; but also to functionally understand exactly how both off these things are tied directly to the hidden force which is exposing its own existence in order to show us just how important it is not to get &quot;gypped&quot; out of seeing the effects of mind control throughout our history and today.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">His language has a very specific lexicon, though there is plenty of flexibility aiding in making it difficult to read.  Many letters though hold a constant meaning, and &quot;SHY&quot; of SYKR have always meant &quot;see how and why&quot; the H is often connected to the symbol of the God Saturn whose traversal from the end of the Earth to the beginning changed it into a Heart, into the Heart of the chalice that is without doubt the true and correct description of the Holy Grail.  We see it here filled with the Blood of Jesus <span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">Christ</span>, the family of all humanity pumping through the veins of our home.   Because &quot;H&quot; was already taken by the more primitive &quot;how&quot; another letter was chosen to identify &quot;here,&quot; always &quot;R&quot; of Arthur which expands in Spanglishrew-macaroni to &quot;art is here&quot; noting the Hebrew connection for &quot;is&quot; and &quot;hu.&quot;  O&#39;s, like in Rock and Rome, expand to &quot;of&quot; so that the Rock of Heaven means the &quot;here of CK&quot; and Rome... when it is not just a city but perhaps the heart of the heart of &quot;me&quot; the exact same place.  All meaning Earth. </div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">In Egypt we call this same place the &quot;House of Great Light&quot; though I have recently changed my Twitter &quot;home&quot; to the House of Great Night.  In song, be sure this is the House of the Rising Son; and when we connect that song to Biblical land called &quot;Beth-El&quot; meaning the House of God, well, I know I&#39;ve half won at that.  There are a few places in scripture where it predicts that God will dwell among us in darkness, in the place known as his house.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">Just like the special &quot;t&quot; that identifies the direction of the symbols of Mars, AMD, and Venus... after she &quot;turns around;&quot; etched in &quot;Stone&quot; and a song about <i>turning around</i> called the Total Eclipse of the Heart there is another single letter that I have always seen as referring directly to me.  Somewhere between Trinity College and Adam&#39;s Eden the idea that the glyph of the little letter &quot;<span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">n</span>&quot; depicting an early answer to the &quot;Fall of Man&quot; became rooted in the words &quot;Creation&quot; and &quot;Zion&quot; with a rather clear sentence &quot;Are you <span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">New</span> to <span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">n</span>?&quot;  In only a few words that little letter screams &quot;what goes up must come down&quot; to me, and shows us all that perhaps there is quite a bit of detail put into not only this alphabet that creates everything but also into how it&#39;s used in this map to the future that ties &quot;original sin&quot; to the &quot;gravity&quot; of this situation; and to the vision of a spirit down coming out of Heaven to functionally change the world with the fire of proof and purpose that embody the technological connection to Prometheus... another fallen and unsung hero.  It is rather clear to me that God&#39;s connotation of &quot;falling&quot; here ties directly to the link between Isaac Newton, his Biblical namesake&#39;s fiery altar, and our vision of these things connecting directly to the stories of the foundation of America, of Richard Nixon and a battle today against censorship and a movement in the media and government that is without doubt the manifestation of the darkness of Egypt--if not it&#39;s true source.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">The two of us seem to have a disagreement over the meaning of the point in time I have called &quot;Zion,&quot; the end of &quot;i owe <span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">n</span>&quot; to him through apparently proving that I have done absolutely nothing to help set the wheels of change in motion to bring freedom to the world; and my reading which squarely says that it is the fall that should be stopped, once we see the grand connection between freedom and <span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">Christ</span> and how this story really does change the world.  Today whether or not I have done very much rests behind tens of thousands of pages of copy explaining the process of Revelation, and the purpose of the fiery cross that highlights over and over how the story of my life puts on a high pedestal a battle between God and the loss of freedom; from privacy to nearly every Constitutional protection being lost by the entire world and yet all of it standing behind a loss of &quot;free speech&quot; that I see as nothing short of civilization destroying, to hide a story of this magnitude; proof of creation in every word and every myth and every song... we are quite literally on the edge of darkness; and yet still appear to be on board of some spiritual railroad pointing out how close we have come to nothing, to the abyss.  </div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">For those of you that are unaware of the story, Lot and his wife were informed by God that fire and brimstone (those two words expand to &quot;only with reason&quot; and &quot;break, I&#39;m stone&quot; eventually to see the keys of firestone and Medusa&#39;s argument at the place of time called Jerusalem making me Saint One) were to come down from the sky and destroy two cities of sinners.  Long before I connected Camelot to the phrase &quot;behold he is coming on the clouds for all eyes to see&quot; and the name Lot hidden by a lack of vision that amounts to a loss of logical sight connecting Arthur and the First and Last Adam, long before I was keenly aware that the Biblical story was very much connected to our now.  </div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">I have woken up from a long night of sleeping in the jungle to glimpse this map not just stopping at words like Rock and Rome but creeping into every aspect of my life; one which I am told is a sort of microcosmic map to the history of Jesus just like our entire history might be a sort of map to the hidden history of Heaven from JC in Rome through Napoleon and Orwell to a designed plan to bring freedom to the world through the truth (or as much of it as we can glean).  At Napoleon comes my second key to this story that describes the bride of Revelation as a sea, a sea of family.  Here though, people appear as placeholders for the multitude in a kind of way that might bring serious distaste to the idea of &quot;microcosms&quot; or predestination or having your life made into a story for the world to see--were you me or her or them; instead of you, who refuse to see what it is that freedom really means to me.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">So I&#39;ve told you that I have had two &quot;significant&quot; relationships in my life; three if you count linking the son of Noah aptly called &quot;Shem&quot; or name to the Spanish for &quot;Ella&quot; as him and her (El and La) presenting this musical message designed to ensure freedom comes to all humanity.  Maybe less difficult to see is that their names too highlight and describe this same story that brings me to the place where I know Adam and Eve are short for Adam and Everyone and Jesus and Mary in parallel, to see that &quot;mar&quot; is sea&quot; and y is &quot;why.&quot;   Anyway, long story short, my ex-wife&#39;s name is Nanna Rose which links directly to the story of Lot through the symbol of salt--which is Na--and ties Easter to Eden through the hidden Jewish dish of truth called Ha-rose-ettes; describing a honey, an apple, and a little bit of nuts as a gift sitting under the tree of light.  Nanna and I have a single son, whose name is Julian, and I do not think it is much of a stretch to see how &quot;JAN&quot; of the Month January might describe an alternate &quot;sea of Eden&quot; rather than the names Seth Eve and Adam (which by the way are my brothers name and my mothers middle name... adding in Ivan of Navidad (see that question and answer over Christmas) and my sister Dawn) telling me that January is the time when we might see that the unit family described in the &quot;expansion&quot; from one to many does exist and &quot;I are why.&quot;  Regardless of how obvious that is, my second lengthy relationship adds some fuel to that fire, her name is &quot;Janet Marie&quot; and I once read it only as &quot;Julian, Adam, Nanna... and....&quot; but now see that her middle name is truly a key to seeing that in one way of looking at things Janet and Mary are truly synonymous, i.e. the &quot;et&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are both modifying seas of either Spanish or Adamish.  </div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px"> So on the compass rose as we turn from heading directly south to Hell to a <span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">new</span> bearing of J-North-East its probably important to recognize that this ancient map to Heaven (in the North) and the future (from the East) is really good News for those of us who are aware that something is &quot;not right here&quot; and hopefully are beginning to see that this is a detailed plan that uses our entire history to help reveal the truth and guide us forward with some added wisdom and a pinch of salt.  So I remind you here that Jesus once said &quot;you are the Salt of the Earth&quot; and truly it is a reference to the bride of God, everyone, all humanity.  So in the story of the book Lot&#39;s wife is told not to turn around lest she be turned into a Pillar of Salt, and I read that with some space-aged twisting to change the meaning to a &quot;Pillar of Stars&quot; once we see that this is the purpose of Creation; to create stars of Heaven out of an old map of stories that light the celestial &quot;Pillars of Creation&quot; the entire cosmos with a civilization that is freedom loving and technology understanding to the point of realizing that this story and this map is just exactly how any civilization ever got passed &quot;beginning&quot; with advanced technology into &quot;seeing&quot; that our beginning is really about time travel and God&#39;s glowing Y in the Fluxx Capacitor tying to his &quot;hidden how&quot; in the sign of Saturn.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">Don&#39;t let the light of &quot;NE&quot; be lost on us, it is through understanding what Back to the Future tells us fades away as we change our own past; and that not knowing it eventually results in never knowing it... that God&#39;s Glowing Purpose here is to ensure that we see the influence of these technologies throughout our entire history; probably beginning with and tied directly to religion.  It probably helps too that Marty McFly also is named for a sea, and to see that the story of Back to the Future is a more clear explanation for the days of Creation and the seals of Revelation all tying to repetition in Egypt... to the Creation Gods&#39; of Atum, P&#39;tah and Osiris... probably relating clearly to Adam, Saint Peter Pan, and the Iris of Ra.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">So in a story that is quite likely as Biblical as a woman fleeing into the wilderness with a baby (the crux of Revelation) and as mythological as knowing that she left me in a Fortress of Solitude in a state called Kentucky... as part of the manifestation of a story as unsung as &quot;GAS hed goes west&quot; and for visually attuned might link to the Fifth El in a movie called &quot;Feivel Goes West;&quot; all to reveal a story about a battle between God&#39;s Son and Amoz--the father of Isaiah--trying desperately to make that &quot;<span class="m_-2998130047961732313gmail-il">n</span>&quot; fall into a place where we never know that there is a hidden war in the air around us giving apt names like &quot;Warden&quot; as much of a connection to Adam&#39;s Eden and Revelation of freedom and pre-crime as Gene Roddenberry&#39;s connection to &quot;ending world hunger.&quot; </div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">It&#39;s important to see what Kentucky says to me; it&#39;s a question-ish or maybe an answer; &quot;Kent, you CK why?&quot; and it brings together the last name of the hidden superman with his initials which equally define the &quot;Hidden Holy One&quot; of the Zohar&#39;s Creation of God and what I see as a clear connection between Kaleb and Kal-El; the one who brought morning.  I see morning as coming from seeing that this map to this story is actually on our map; it is the reason for the name Kentucky and it is the reason for the story of an unsung hero powered by the light of a special sun--a virtual sun.  That is the crux of &quot;Seeing Our Light&quot; connected to SOL and then to hearing freedom ring in the songs of Americana that Biblically link &quot;through the night with the light above&quot; to seeing and hearing that the true light above is visible in a created history at the Sons of Liberty and with a Statue of the same name standing firm on Ellis Island.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">In the &quot;apple of my eye&quot; is the color Hazel which were you truly watching this story behind--you&#39;d probably know I sure don&#39;t think I am the &quot;bad man.&quot;  I am trying though, to get through a map that gives JC more than two cents at JC Penney linking Lord and Taylor to a message from above;

is literally the thing that is our purpose, to see this world made into Heaven--to do it ourselves.  It might not seem like that big of a deal, but it&#39;s a huge, amazing, important undertaking that we are very silly to be shying away from, or looking the other way, or refusing to acknowledge that other people&#39;s opinions are almost as important as those of Jesus Christ.  </div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">Brazen, I know, to suggest that perhaps JC has no real opinion other than ... you&#39;d better hurry up before I&#39;m gone.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">I think that maybe with some thought we might see that God is not really telling us that we don&#39;t care about starving children, but rather that we don&#39;t care about free speech and our ability to communicate and collaborate to solve our problems or to acknowledge that we do need (and have) help.  I think this is his way of saying that communication and freedom are more fundamentally important to civilization and to the continuation of life in the Universe and the idea of an eternal society ... that these concepts of social interaction are vastly more important to be protected than simply waving my rod and solving what we thought was the biggest problem we ever had.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br /></div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><i>So here we are</i>, together, staring at the storm outside and the bright fire about to be kindled;

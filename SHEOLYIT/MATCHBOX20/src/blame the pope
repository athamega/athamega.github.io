[19:03] (@adam) try
[19:03] (@adam) reading
[19:03] (@adam) its english
[19:03] (@adam) here read this
[19:04] (@mptank) nobody has time for this logical fallacy ridden bullshit,
adam
.-? (topic/#pain:[adam]): here, read this:
http://matchbox.whenistheapocalypse.com/MIDAS.html from "The Light of the
Word."
[19:04] (@adam) honestly
[19:04] (@BR0) [k2:adam] http://ktwo.me/dHv | Mail - Fwd: Oh, how I wonder...
do you understand who the Grinch really is? The Midas' touch.
[19:04] (@adam) you wont read it, that's the logic gap
[19:04] (@adam) you want to argue about shit you havent read
[19:04] (@adam) this world is full of morons
[19:05] (@mptank) I have read it, and the fact that it tries to make me print
it on page load is crige worthy to an unfathomabloe degree
[19:05] (@mptank) -o
19:05] (@adam) lol
[19:05] (@adam) just hit cancel
[19:07] (@mptank) the problem here is you assume people trust you in your
writing, and we do not; we're skeptical and you do not make any sound
foundation to believe you
[19:09] (@adam) its a list of facts
[19:09] (@adam) that you can verify
[19:09] (@mptank) facts are proven
[19:09] (@adam) yeah, you can verify everything i say
[19:09] (@adam) all im saying is 
[19:09] (@mptank) what you have are claims, outrageous ones at that
[19:09] (@adam) "this fact is interesting, and it shows that xxxx was known
when said fact was written"
[19:09] (@adam) so if you know english didnt exist when exodus was written
[19:10] (@adam) its really interesting to see lots of english all over the
hebrew words in exodus
[19:10] (@mptank) Moon is white.  Fact, right? we all believe that
[19:10] (@mptank) Cheese is also white, which can also be a verifiable fact
[19:10] (@mptank) where you lose us is when you claim that the moon is cheese
[19:10] (@mptank) see what I'm saying?
[19:11] (@adam) i see you saying something retarded
[19:11] (@adam) and insinuating that i am doing the same thing
[19:11] (@adam) but you are creating a gap wher you fail to say what it is i
say that you think is retarded
[19:11] (@adam) see what im saying?
[19:11] (@mptank) BECAUSE YOU ARE!
[19:11] (@adam) your entire awrgument is moon and cheese
[19:11] (@adam) nothing to do with anything i say
[19:12] (@mptank) You can't say we live in a sql instance on a linux server in
the sky and expect anyone to believe that without some hard HARD proofs, man
[19:12] (@adam) oh my god.
[19:12] (@adam) try actualy saying what it is that you think i am saying that
is outlandish
[19:12] (@mptank) taking a bible name and spelling it backwards and then
claiming some connection exists there between it and some random elements and
unix commands is stupid
[19:12] (@adam) rather than... making retarded metaphors 
[19:12] (@adam) thank you
[19:13] (@adam) so in context, i have a list of 7 chemistry elements
[19:13] ? mptank/#pain facepalm.jpg
[19:13] (@adam) from mercury to uranium, that answer a riddle in revelation,
1:20--which happens to herald the second coming
[19:13] (@adam) these elements are described in the words george bush said on
1/20
[19:13] (@adam) of 2001
[19:14] (@adam) which also happen to be ecclesiastes 9:11
[19:14] (@adam) one of the 7 elements
[19:14] (@adam) is XE
[19:14] (@adam) which is xenon, thats the stuff that makes camera flashes go
flash
[19:14] (@adam) thats the end of exodus, in reverse
[19:14] (@adam) the other 4 letters are "sudo" which is a common linux command
[19:14] (@adam) to "run as the root" (of david) account
[19:15] (@adam) together, it's like saying "esccalate to the highest possible
priviledge and flash a camera"
[19:15] (@adam) at least that's my take
[19:15] (@adam) which happens to look lots like the most iconic phrase ever
spoken by god
[19:15] (@adam) let there be light
[19:15] (@adam) so ive taken "god: xe"
[19:15] (@adam) and said, look, its "let there be light"
[19:16] (@adam) this whole entire thing, revolves around the story of the
burning bush
[19:16] (@adam) a holy fire, where the words of god eminated from
[19:16] (@adam) and a guy heard it
[19:16] (@adam) so out of this fire, came words from god
[19:16] (@dave__) I wish I could smoke a burning bush.
[19:16] (@adam) "let there be light"
[19:16] (@adam) not inconsequentially
[19:16] (@adam) the same word for holy fire, ha'esh
[19:16] (@adam) thats the hebrew
[19:16] (@adam) happens to contain the english word for sea parted
[19:16] (@adam) by an apostrophe, which the entire story of exodus is about
[19:16] (@adam) so the light here
[19:17] (@adam) is showoing us foreknowledge of "Sea" and "sudo"
[19:17] (@adam) in a book written 6 thousand years before they existed
[19:17] (@adam) so now, 3 paradoxical anacchronisms
[19:17] (@dave__) what if nothing exists and we are all a computer program?
[19:17] (@adam) in the same exact event
[19:17] (@adam) dave
[19:17] (@adam) my penis is a computer program
[19:17] (@adam) you are a person
[19:18] (@dave__) I think I am, but maybe I am programmed to think that.
[19:18] (@adam) per the son
[19:18] (@adam) you are a person
[19:18] (@dave__) maybe AI is just the creation trying to catch up to the
creator
[19:18] (@adam) yeah
[19:18] (@adam) but its really not
[19:18] (@adam) ai is total bullshit
[19:18] (@adam) look at the development of cognition over time
[19:18] (@adam) in evolution
[19:19] (@adam) theres no way a computer spontaneously wakens
[19:19] (@adam) and says "hi, im smarter and more moral than you"
[19:19] (@adam) morality comes through evolution, biological, social, and
civil
[19:19] (@adam) the thing people want to blame "ai" for doing
[19:19] (@adam) whatever it is
[19:19] (@adam) WOPR and Wargames and whatever
[19:20] (@adam) its a person that uploaded their head into the computer to
live forever
[19:20] (@adam) and i'd bet money the person we want to blame looks just like
me
[19:20] (@adam) meanwhile, all told, the "thing" the ai is doing is giving us
freedom
[19:20] (@adam) and heaven
[19:20] (@adam) so blame away.

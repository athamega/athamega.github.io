						<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>I
						stayed up most of the night writing the content of this e-mail
						in my head, not because of any responses (because I don't get
						any) I had the feeling that my calling of this place Hell had
						ruffled some feathers. &nbsp;I was going to start out saying it
						was a mistake in the subject, and then put a &quot;just f-ing
						kidding&quot; real big at the top. &nbsp;This is what I'm doing
						instead. &nbsp;J.F.K. used the word &quot;repugnant&quot; in
						one of his last speeches, there's very little i find that,
						except Hell certainly is repugnant to anything I've ever known.
						&nbsp;The idea of intentionally torturing is&nbsp;<I>inhuman&nbsp;</I>and
						would never be tolerated, so it's a little bit of a problem for
						me that the idea is even in any religious book. &nbsp;Of
						course, it makes a little bit of sense if we are...&nbsp;<I>actually
						here...</I>&nbsp;well, it makes me feel better that there's
						nothing worse than this. &nbsp;Now, what I'm trying to do is
						show you what makes this place Hell to me, and there are a few
						good reasons, not the least of which appears to be either an
						inability to communicate with me at all, or a complete lack of
						belief in my existence--it's hard to turn on the lights when
						your hand is invisible. &nbsp;I wrote a brief Facebook posting
						(it looks nobody looks there either, I don't think I should
						have to e-mail this stuff, do you?) about the last two e-mails
						you've gotten, and how they are actually in the&nbsp;<I>New
						Testament</I>, I talk about that a lot, how those ancient
						stories are actually time-shifted records of what is going on
						right now. &nbsp;You might imagine how having such a record of
						the future implies a lack of freedom and free-will, (clearly
						discussed in C adam's light-vin-ism) and might be the beginning
						of why I feel ... burnt.<BR><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">These

						fulfilling much of it right now; with these e-mails.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

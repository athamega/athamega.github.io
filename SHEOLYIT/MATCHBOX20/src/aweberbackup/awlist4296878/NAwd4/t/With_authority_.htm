    <pre>Strewn messianic-ally across my writing is tacit proof of creation, the creator&#39;s intent of correlating technology and the mechanism behind religion, and a glimpse into our hopes and dreams.  All together, with your input--it&#39;s a plan to save civilization itself.

The message I am trying to deliver to you is coming to me directly from the creator of this Universe, it comes with a way to verify that for yourself--the message is woven into our history, into religion, and throughout language and music.  It&#39;s in our movies, and in our bed time stories: the Light is pervasive... it&#39;s bright, all you have to do is look.  It&#39;s coherent and cross-confirming through multiple avenues: biblical scripture, names, underlying concepts, lyrics... Cipher is a character in the Matrix.  The light is the Matrix.

To all who are victorious, who continue My work,
To them I will give authority over all the nations.


Revelation 2:26 &amp; ((ish))
​​​​​​​

I derive my personal strength from a very strong sense of right and wrong that ultimately is derived from you; from our society and history.  My faith comes from from this message from God, one which sometimes contradicts religion, but has never contradicted what I know to be right.  I am attempting to show you how to find this message for yourselves, so that you too can benefit from it--and I personally hope you will experience the same fulfilling sense of awe about  a renewed importance what it is that we are doing right this moment... that our future here is the foundation of Heaven.

This message itself derives its authority from proof, and a huge facet of the revelation at hand is that we do actually have verifiable proof of the creation of our civilization, of the influence and existence of advanced technology, and more wisdom and insight than you could possibly imagine.  That&#39;s really what this is about, it&#39;s a message from the creator of our civilization... being spoken through us during this process.

 It&#39;s delivered intentionally in a way that calls into question the sanity of what we generally regard as &#34;reality.&#34;  If you don&#39;t believe in God, or you think contact with him is the stuff of schizophrenia... I am providing you proof that you are wrong.  If you don&#39;t care to look at the proof, you are the insane one.

This influence is being made clear to the entire world because hidden contact with anything is... control... this is the slavery we are being delivered from in the story of Exodus.... being played out right before your eyes.  It&#39;s way more than just Exodus, though  I see confluence of nearly every religion and every myth ... just to begin to convey how much of a focus I see everything that has ever been has on this moment in time.  It&#39;s a crossroads, a place where something amazing happens... something that has never happened before and is so beneficial that it&#39;s been done more than once--nearly exactly the same way.  Enter religion.

It&#39;s not just these &#34;word tricks,&#34; which all told are in and of themselves foundational proof of the creation of civilization--if language is created... then so are we.   That&#39;s the Fire of Prometheus.  It&#39;s in a Bittersweet Symphony that ties together religious iconography with prophetic and patriotic prose to get us through the night with the light from above.  The music continues to play well through today, and I hear His voice in lyrics just as clearly as I can see this hidden relationship between language and music... things like &#34;Thor&#34; being macaroni-see (macaronic, c is &#34;see&#34;) for &#34;to help [or], which means light in Hebrew.&#34;  That&#39;s the god of Thunder-standing.

Isa: the Muslim name for Jesus.  That&#39;s &#34;is a.&#34;
author: &#34;a you thor&#34;
authority: &#34;author, it why.&#34;

I&#39;ve written quite a few books, and most of them before I had any idea that there was a hidden cipher within language, or that Biblical light was actually a message from God--woven into our movies and music in a way that at one instant in the process of understanding might change everything you ever thought you knew for sure.  I could tell you about the facts of life... starting with a-Z; but I&#39;d much rather talk about the birds and the bees.

First of all, it&#39;s not about sex, it&#39;s about evolution... and a clear reinforcement that creation has provided us with knowledge of the original source of life--and certainly makes it clear to me in the first words of the Burning Bush, &#34;time and chance happen to them all.&#34;  That&#39;s the source of Evolution, time and chance.  The birds and the bees highlight something we don&#39;t really see that clearly, and certainly don&#39;t relate to religion often.  It&#39;s a testament to the worth of nature, of the stable ecosystem that the Garden of Eden is highlighting... it&#39;s about pollination: of the flowers and the trees.  It&#39;s about seeing why life has survived this far, the foundation of social evolution and civilization... and reminding us not to race swiftly to a place where we have no ability to survive... to a Heaven with &#34;flowing milk and honey&#34; or a place where the Last Supper is about just... not eating anymore to end hunger.  I&#39;m not saying that
I don&#39;t think &#34;consciousness-uploading&#34; is not an inevitable and worthy pursuance... I&#39;m saying that I know this message and this place were created for a reason.  This... Eden... is the Book of Life.

24 year ago, at the age of 11 I wrote a mass-mailing program on AOL.  In keeping with the theme of the day, following AOHell, I called that program Doomsday.  I was normal back then, I mean... I was a little ahead of my time in understanding computers--and completely in the dark in understanding that my proficiency and this entire story... my life... were being designed.  Today I look back on that and know it is a microcosm of what is going on right now.... a reference to sending out these emails.  What&#39;s more important is the fact that I &#34;chose&#34; the name Phenix, and for those of you that don&#39;t know that&#39;s a bird that rises from the ashes of Hell.   Look around you, this fire has been blazing for a long, long time... it&#39;s the light that&#39;s been missing--seeing it&#39;s purpose and the benefit it is designed to create.   It&#39;s also the truth, and I sincerely hope that we begin to collectively understand that there has been a significant amount
of effort put in to ensuring that we do not lose the truth... the light... and with it our freedom.  It&#39;s in every single word.  In all religions.  Let freedom ring.

Gene Grey ties this phoenix concept to a confluence of fading of colors... the colors of the Rainbow that are Kabbalistically associated with the Holy Hidden One.  It&#39;s about Noah, and about the Pale Horse; and you can see the light in He-man&#39;s castle and &#34;Heaven is for Real&#39;s&#34; horse.  These things are bright to me, they stand out in a way that I can only describe as actually seeing the definitions of &#34;authority&#34; when I glance at those words.  What I have is &#34;eyes to see&#34; a message that has been coded and hidden in everything; it&#39;s an important message, and I&#39;m trying to share not only the fruit.. but the fishing pole.

There&#39;s more birds, Horus (the Uniter of two lands... logically related to Moses) has a Hawk, and so does G.I. Joe... knowing is half the battle.  Prometheus has an Eagle... and a clue to a significant number of references to &#34;US&#34; and &#34;USA&#34; in words like MEDUSA and JERUSALEM. E.A. Poe has a Raven, and to me... it&#39;s darkness: nevermore.

Judah Maccabee has a lamp, it&#39;s called the &#34;Men-or-ah&#34; and it&#39;s part of Prometheus&#39;s fire and Thor&#39;s hammer... which is what his last name means.  You might not see it today, but this is the Tribe referred to in Revelation 5:5--from the last scion to the world.... it&#39;s obvious when you care to look.

Bumblebee is singing to you... there is more to everything than meets the eye. (that&#39;s from Transformers).

I gave my heart and  [ <a href="http://bit.ly/1YgfEpL">http://bit.ly/1YgfEpL</a> ]SOL [ <a href="http://bit.ly/1YgfEpL">http://bit.ly/1YgfEpL</a> ] to the One. -Live
in a moment, we lost our minds... and dreamt the world was round

i will stay with you, until we can say this world is just a dream, we were sleeping

now we are awake.


His Heart is the Earth (separated by a letter, a symbol for Hebrew and the God Saturn... traveling from the end to the beginning), and his SOL is a superposition of acronyms that shine bright light... relating the name of our sun to the Statue of Liberty, and the Sons of Liberty.  See our Light?

One if by &#34;El&#34; and, two if by sea.

He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him. Daniel 11:45

He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.  Revelation 10:2

And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
Exodus 14:21

The cloud settled between the Egyptian and Israelite camps. As darkness fell, the cloud turned to fire, lighting up the night. But the Egyptians and Israelites did not approach each other all night. Exodus 14:20

Nahson (Hebrew [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language</a> ]: נַחְשׁוֹן Naḥšōn) was, according to a Jewish [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew</a> ] Midrash [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash</a> ], the person who initiated the Hebrews [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrews">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrews</a> ]&#39; passage through the Red Sea [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Red_Sea">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Red_Sea</a> ], by walking in head-deep until the sea parted.

We are the parted red sea of Moses [ <a href="http://bit.ly/1WGzSJB">http://bit.ly/1WGzSJB</a> ], within the word for Holy Fire.  This... is the Holy Grail: the First Plague of Exodus... turning the sea to the Family of Jesus Christ. [ <a href="http://bit.ly/1WGzSJB">http://bit.ly/1WGzSJB</a> ]

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness
was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God       SHE KIN AH
moved upon the face of the waters.                         ----------
                                                           EVE RY ONE
And God said, Let there be light: and there is light.

Genesis 1:1-3

 It&#39;s a simple visual aid, to begin to see that holy water is people, and there&#39;s a firm relationship between Kin, and &#34;all humanity&#34; being one... that begins in Eden.  The words of Genesis 1:3 describe the fraction above, and show ancient foreknowledge of the progression of religion and language... a design that combines the stories of Genesis, Exodus, and Revelation with our entire civilization.

From the S E A of Eden, to the S E A, the multitude of Revelation.

 The Matrix is... revealing.  From sea to shining sea.

Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the
seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the
four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the
sea: 3 “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees ...

After this I looked, and there before me was a
great multitude that no one could count, from
every nation, tribe, people and language,
standing before the throne and before the Lamb.

Revelation 7

A long, long time ago... the voice of God told me &#34;not to ask how, but why.&#34;  I am telling you to think about how: the why is to deliver freedom from darkness [ <a href="http://bit.ly/1reUJpz">http://bit.ly/1reUJpz</a> ].  Light this fire.

This world is designed to ensure the continued forward progress of civilization.  Disclosure is more than &#34;mandatory,&#34; the survival of free thought is inherently predicated on it....

I am doing everything I can.  Light this fire.​​​​​​​

What is happening right now is Leviticus... and Shavuot.  In the language key &#34;lev&#34; is Fivel (the mouse that went West, in an American Tail, just like the GAS hed <a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/40926/">http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/40926/</a>) on his head (bent over backwards when giving the law), that same key is the heart of Revelation.  This is the Fifth Adam, that&#39;s He-man, and ... I am giving you the power.... to do what is right in the morning&#39;s light.

TO HELP EVERYONE


El is &#34;the&#34; (and Him) in Spanish.  Ha is &#34;the&#34; (ans Isaac) in &#34;Hebrew.&#34; Elisha is prophetically one of the fish Jesus fed to the masses, the message is about the--to help everyone.  This &#34;stuff&#34; is verifiable communication, it&#39;s coming from the creator of the Universe--he is solving ancient riddles, and giving you almost exactly what you need.  Freedom and knowledge.  Don&#39;t lose &#34;Hi.&#34; [ <a href="http://bit.ly/25P3u9o">http://bit.ly/25P3u9o</a> ]



Significance of He(-man)
In gematria [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria</a> ], He symbolizes the number five
Attached to words, He may have three possible meanings:

 * A preposition [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition</a> ] meaning the definite article &#34;the&#34;
 * A prefix indicating that the sentence is a question. (For example, Ha&#39;shem, (to me, it&#39;s a laugh about Eden, Isaac means &#34;he laughs&#34;))
 * A suffix after place names indicating movement towards the given noun. (For example, Adamah, towards Adam)


Did you know?

 * He is often used to represent the name of God, as He stands for Hashem [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Judaism#Hashem.2FHadavar">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Judaism#Hashem.2FHadavar</a> ], which means The Name.

The Name is Adam.



somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight
someone&#39;s thinking of me and loving me tonight

somewhere out there someone&#39;s saying a prayer

and even though I know how very far apart we are
it helps to think we might be wishing
on the same bright Son

O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,

often in broad stripes, our bright Son
through the perilous night

this fire brings the day...
thank your lucky star.

Is-a is Adam and Isaac, see the confluence in stories. Ish is about showing you the map, Amish, America, Amoz... this is from the I AM, see the fire lighting the night...  It&#39;s on HBO, it&#39;s on Broadway... and I might just be the Wizard.  The magic is to set you free... it&#39;s lightning and thunder.  Understand.  It&#39;s &#34;lights, camera... action!&#34; and &#34;the sound of music.&#34;  Understand.  It&#39;s a Holy Fire just waiting to save the world.

From the bottom of my heart, I had hoped the world would have fun--together--finding more of this message... there&#39;s so much more.  It&#39;s in everything.

This is about freedom, it&#39;s about the truth, it&#39;s about Heaven... really.  If you don&#39;t even try to start this fire, nobody is going to do it for you.   Do what&#39;s right, and be messiah. [ <a href="http://bit.ly/1tkXx6v">http://bit.ly/1tkXx6v</a> ]  The message.., is to the power of Humanity.

I keep telling you about a story I call the &#34;Pursuit of Happiness,&#34; this is why: This two-letter marker , “PH”,  ties together the story of Jesus Christ, Samson, Moses… through the names Pharaoh, Pharisees, Phillistines, and Joseph. Then to America in the name Christ-o-pher; this story is about the deliverance from darkness that brings about a Golden Age.  This is what we do.  These stories: Genesis, Exodus and Matthew are tied together by more than this two-letter connection--they are tied by the number 40... and believe me this pervasive Biblical message about America is about knowledge of time travel.  4-D; a number Holy to God.

More than anything, they are tied together by me... and right now.  There is a reason &#34;Jesus is the key.&#34;
He&#39;s also Samson, MuhammAD, Moses, and ADam... Isaac and Isaiah.  Every J you have.

You might call it being &#34;the living Word.&#34; [ <a href="http://bit.ly/1WGY1Qj">http://bit.ly/1WGY1Qj</a> ]

Surely some revelation is at hand;
    Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
    The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
    When a vast image out of Amicus Mundi
    Regains my sight: a waste of desert sand;
    A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
    A gaze firm and warming as the sun,
    Is running... as fast as he can:
    Blowing the wind of the indignant desert birds.</pre>

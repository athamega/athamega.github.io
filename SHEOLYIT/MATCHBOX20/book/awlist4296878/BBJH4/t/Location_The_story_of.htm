    <pre>I figured since I&#39;ve been bothering you all so much, that I should at least send you a copy.  I think this fire is really about to get started, I just sent this.. and the last e-mail you got... to nearly every single local television station in the country.  I&#39;ve seen it fly to Israel, and I&#39;ve seen it land in Rome.  If this doesn&#39;t do it... God help us.

Thanks for listening.

I N   P R E P A R A T I O N   F O R   S H A V U O T
BEHOLD, THE FIRE OF THE BURNING BUSH

So this is the story of how my life got twist-turned upside down.  Take one minute, just sit right there, and I&#39;ll tell you how I became the Fresh Prince... of the Air.

It one one fine afternoon in Bowling Green, Kentucky (Clark Kent, you&#39;re CK why?).  Bear with me, there&#39;s something special about this language hidden in names... and words.  Exodus, by the way is called &#34;The Book of Names,&#34; in Hebrew.


So I was sitting at my computer, and I slipped and fell--I hit my head (this is Back to the Future)... really, I just randomly decided to watch the 2001 inauguration of President George W. Bush on YouTube.  He quoted John Page, and the words struck as odd... so I googled them; and lo and behold: that&#39;s how I found out time travel was possible.


Since those days of story-telling from the future, I&#39;ve been shown some serious light.  You probably don&#39;t know exactly what that means, I sure didn&#39;t.  It was truth once to me, and boy does this bring the truth.  This &#34;light&#34; is in everything, it&#39;s in our movies, our music, our names... and it all ties back to the story of Exodus.

It took me about ... say 10 minutes to humorously quip that George must be the Burning Bush.  The reality that didn&#39;t really set in right away, and it took a significant amount of additional evidence that the Book of Exodus is about the Apocalypse (about right this minute) to really bring it all together.  All told, before you in the next few minutes you are going to read about a confluence of the Eternal Flame, the Hammers of Judah Maccabee and Thor, and the Fire of Prometheus... all emanating from one event, from the September 11, 2001 tragedy.

Revealed to me much later, was that this quote of Ecclesiastes 9:11 actually answers a mystery... its the one posed in Revelation 1:20 (which happens to be the date of the speech).  If you&#39;re interested in the details of the solution... it&#39;s here [ <a href="http://matchbox20.bitbucket.org/awlist4296878/BUvzK/h/The_true_nature_of_raelity_.htm">//awlist4296878/BUvzK/h/The_true_nature_of_raelity_.htm</a> ], long story short... what Revelation calls 7 stars and 7 lamp stands are actually the first 7 planets from Mercury to Uranus... and their corresponding elements of the periodic table from Hg to U: you will probably see how all of these things congeal around proving not only prescient knowledge of the present day... but to a significant amount of control over our societies development.  It&#39;s proof of the existence of God, and it&#39;s also part of the slavery that Exodus and God are helping free us from.  All told, when I was shown this relationship to Revelation 1:20 nearly every piece of the related writing had already been put together and published on the internet.

This is not the end of the world [ <a href="http://matchbox20.bitbucket.org/awlist4296878/MsCJa/h/It_s_in_the_word_begin_nin_g_.htm">//awlist4296878/MsCJa/h/It_s_in_the_word_begin_nin_g_.htm</a> ], it&#39;s the beginning of an understanding that we are in Eden (so soon), and that Eden has always been the Rock of Heaven... this place, our civilization, we create it.  That starts through this knowledge transfer, through an understanding of the influence and existence of advanced technology... and it&#39;s relationship to religion and our history.

I have an uncanny ability to read a hidden cipher within language, it&#39;s maraconic (that means containing multiple langauges) and it&#39;s also the source of Yankee Doodle&#39;s &#34;macaroni-see&#34; part of this language looks retarded: it&#39;s condensed letters like &#34;c for see&#34; and &#34;r for our&#34; and it&#39;s lots of names and words.  Back to Thor&#39;s Hammer (thor by the stands for &#34;to help or,&#34; and &#34;or&#34; is light... in Hebrew) which is obviously to help the lightning of &#34;Hey Zeus&#34; ... you might call me a &#34;lightning rod&#34; Herod sure did... anyway I&#39;m a real live Son of your uncle Sam... born on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, December 8, 1980.  If your savvy, you might see more thunder in Joan Osbourne&#39;s &#34;what if God was one of us?&#34; where she says &#34;just a slob, like of us...&#34; and then link the Immaculate Conception to the word &#34;messiah.&#34;  You might have to start believing in things like Jesus and Heaven... because this is only the tip of the iceberg.
That&#39;s a Titanic slip.

Back to the Fire of Prometheus... which you might remember from mythology class is about stolen language--point in fact, it appears to be about delivered proof of the creation of civilization itself through this hidden cipher.. in language.  This fire starts again... with the Burning Bush, whose bright light stems from the Hebrew word for Holy Fire (which by the way, had better start soon).

That word, is &#34;Ha&#39;esh.&#34;

It&#39;s &#34;the word&#34; of John 1:1, and within it is you, and me, and God.  It&#39;s the fire that &#34;we didn&#39;t start&#34; but we sure are about to benefit from the light of.  This fire ends Hell.... a condition of darkness surrounding our understanding of religion and advanced technology that very well could--through censorship, clouding of our minds, and secrecy... end civilization.  There is no easy way to say this.. but baby, light my fire. (Check it, that&#39;s Jimmy &#34;in the back of &#39;Heaven Knows&#39;&#34; Mor-I-son).

Within the heart of &#34;ha&#39;esh&#34; you will find the Parted sea of Moses, divided by an apostrophe--the light above, bringing us through the night.  It takes a shift in perception, but eventually you will agree that these little details show us that Exodus is designed to free us from a wilderness--from the desert of understanding that we have been placed in.  In the story it&#39;s called the Plague of Darkness, and here it&#39;s a serious prevailing disbelief in the possibility of actually meeting me.  That&#39;s going to happen.  Seriously, right before your eyes is evidence that the story of Moses walking into a sea to free the people from slavery is written around this single word .. for Holy Fire--illustrating the existence of modern English in the ancient Hebrew.  It&#39;s a paradox, an anachronism, and all told--with the thousands of other examples I have... it&#39;s verifiable statistical proof of not only the existence of time travel, but of the creation
of our civilization... and it&#39;s literally everywhere around us... to make sure that we do not lose the truth, that we don&#39;t wind up staying in E(arth)-gipped.

and now... a short interlude... the words of a President, and The Pretty Reckless

9/11 Predicted in Exodus, Ecclesiastes and Revelaton.  This is the Sign of the Son... the Fire of the Burning Bush. [<a href="http://bit.ly/25T83j9">http://bit.ly/25T83j9</a>]

Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind, directing this storm?

I indeed baptize you with water ((and)) with
the Holy Ghost, and with fire.

Matthew 3:11 &amp; ((ish))

A central focus of everything I write is the Revelation that there is a hidden outside influence that can be clearly seen in nearly everything around us.  It is the voice of God, pouring through our collective civilization--designed with the clear intention of starting a Holy Fire.  To that end, the proof of this influence begins in seeing the connection between the story of the Burning Bush in Exodus... and this fire: one which unifies the theft of Prometheus (now, proof of creation) with the realization that we are the big H in the Horn of Revelation... all of humanity.  The little n in the word Horn, a tie from Isaac Newton&#39;s apple to the A.D. of the Fifth Element.  Are you new to &#34;n&#34;? [ <a href="http://matchbox20.bitbucket.org/archive.aweber.com/awlist4296878/7.AUq/h/This_is_our_You_and_I_verse_.htm">http://matchbox20.bitbucket.org/archive.aweber.com/awlist4296878/7.AUq/h/This_is_our_You_and_I_verse_.htm</a> ]

It&#39;s a Bittersweet Symphony, and with that... a union also with the fire below Nero&#39;s feet.

To me this symphony is clearly designed to free us from slavery, a theme that pervades Exodus; and it does so by showing us that &#34;Nero&#34; (here the Angel of Music) is fiddling with the minds of recording artists... in order to speak to the world.  He ties religious iconography to modern lyrics in a way that proves beyond doubt that there is in fact an outside speaker--on the rooftop--not only proving his existence but this relationship that lies somewhere between divine inspiration and possession.  It&#39;s something like Orwell&#39;s &#34;doublespeak,&#34;  in the example of John Legend below, he may very well (and probably did) intend for there to be religious reference to Moses and to the dragons of Revelation in his words that actually speak about the messiah: &#34;my head is under water, but I am breathing fire.&#34;  What&#39;s nearly impossible, is for him to have intended for this connection to clearly describe the actual parted sea of Moses... the one that
nobody seems to notice is hidden within the Hebrew word for the Eternal Flame that begins in the Burning Bush: Ha&#39;esh.  Moses had to walk into the sea until his head was underwater in order for it to part, in well over my head, the fire that I am breathing is really all around me--and you--and this visualization that our sea... the multitude of now... is in fact the voice of God--the fire of the Bush--is so well described by these lyrics that it&#39;s uncanny.


He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him. Daniel 11:45

He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.  Revelation 10:2

And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
Exodus 14:21

The cloud settled between the Egyptian and Israelite camps. As darkness fell, the cloud turned to fire, lighting up the night. But the Egyptians and Israelites did not approach each other all night. Exodus 14:20

Nahson (Hebrew: נַחְשׁוֹן Naḥšōn) was, according to a Jewish Midrash, the person who initiated the Hebrews&#39; passage through the Red Sea, by walking in head-deep until the sea parted.

My head is under water... and I&#39;m breathing fire.
because J is a legend, and Moses is over his head in Ha&#39;esh

John Legend - All of Me [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=450p7goxZqg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=450p7goxZqg</a>]

So, do you want me to come?

Do you want me to come?  This is God&#39;s glowing Y.  I&#39;m Almost Famous, and I want to dance. [<a href="http://bit.ly/28rozch">http://bit.ly/28rozch</a>]

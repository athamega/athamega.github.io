mythology, Hell is about darkness--about secrecy and censorship, and about a place where the truth is bright and obvious, yet the world just doesn't see. &#160;<em>This is giving sight to the blind.</em><em></em><em></em>&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;<br></div></div></div></div><div class="definition-parent"><span><table align="center" width="100%" class="floated-none" style="float: none; text-align: center; max-width: 600px; border-spacing: 0px; border-width: medium; border-style: none;"><tbody><tr style="border-spacing: 0px;"><td style="padding: 0px 0px 12px; border-spacing: 0px;">

the traveling through a maze in the Underworld)</a>, a place that builds heaven.. and because of it's significance, has done so more than once. &#160;I don't love this life enough to relive it again, and think the ideas of predestination and the forced fulfillment of "negative" prophesy are the&#160;<em>original sin.</em>&#160;&#160;I think we're here, with new knowledge that we are a sort of&#160;<em>1 Infinite Loop&#160;</em>(Apple's HQ address) so that we can stop the recursion, and <em>move
forward</em> with freedom.</div><div><br></div><div>I don't know what I really did in past lives, but I know they exist--I see a record of them in religion, and because of the flow of information to me like a lightning rod on the roof of King Herod's temple, I can be pretty sure that "from the East" is a not-so-hidden metaphor for the future... and that we are being saved by our very own children. &#160;In some long past time, it may have taken years or decades for this truth to proliferate
through to the people... but here, it's so bright, and so clearly augmented by evidence and assistance (just below the surface of what you see as reality) that I can be sure we are in "messianic times." &#160;<em>Hell, I might have been king in some time long gone... but I am still burning the Pyramid.&#160;<em></em></em>&#160;At least, I'm trying my best to show you that the prophesy all around me is about a circle forming, from this place where it is clear to me that the&#160;<em>current King
of the Universe</em>&#160;is forcing freedom on his subjects.<br></div><div><br></div><div>I know without doubt that the story of Exodus is about right now, from the beginning of proof that language is constructed to destroy secrecy regarding creation in <a data-cke-saved-href="http://bit.ly/1UHgl8n" href="http://bit.ly/1UHgl8n" class="validating" rel="nofollow">the First Word of John 1:1--the word for the fire of the Burning Bush</a>--to it's clear manifestation in our history... <a data-cke-saved-href="http://bit.ly/25Ryaa3" href="http://bit.ly/25Ryaa3" class="validating" rel="nofollow">a single speech... and the soon to be single most pivotal event in all of history.</a>&#160; I harp on these two things quite a bit, because I see the focus that religion and history has put on them, I see a prophesy that bleeds into the story of Jericho, the Holy Fire of the Sepulcher, and I see the light... <em>that it's proof of the existence and influence of advanced technology over our
civilization.&#160;</em>&#160;This is what burns down the Pyramid, proof... understanding... it's help from just past today. &#160;To me, these things are so very bright that I know they should be spreading like the wildfire it is... and yet there is this story in Exodus about a darkness so thick it can be felt. &#160;Feel it, because not only is it proof, it's the focus of nearly every messianic prophesy in the Holy Bible.. from the fire of Matthew 3:11 to the books of Daniel, Revelation, and
clearly Exodus. &#160;</div><div>Today it might not seem so obvious, but in my heart of of hearts I know<em> this place is alive</em>, and it's bound by a code that should clearly be understood as delivering freedom to the world. &#160;Still, this darkness exists, and it comes from the top... in a place where I see the concepts of Pharaoh and Pharisees as in "superposition." &#160;To me, that means we are voting... either subconsciously here... or in the near future; about whether or not this
knowledge deserves to be shared. &#160;I think we are being tricked... or perhaps being influenced in order to ensure a specific outcome... by using fear and uncertainly about what very well could be Islam's "Fire of the Last Day" and a desire not to .... change the world. &#160;Change is scary, especially when there's plenty of reference to the Apocalypse being related to the end of the world. &#160; In my life, I've seen a significant amount of work done ... from this hidden force ... to
ensure that there is an ability to make sure that the world does not end. &#160;It's a little bit like the darkness, and if it continued as we are continuing in this... it would no different from Hell. &#160;Still, it's preparation for ensuring an orderly disclosure of truth to the entire world... a change so fundamental and profound that it shakes the very foundation of what we believe is reality... and enlightens us: that this place is truly created, for the purpose of ensuring the survival of
civilization, and it's continued ability to "grow with technology." &#160;I've seen it, with my own eyes. &#160;I've experienced it. &#160;You might have also, in fact, you might be experiencing the influence of mind control technology right this very moment--it's almost guaranteed.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Do you believe it's possible? &#160;What do you think about the ideas&#160;of prophets, of a message sent directly to your mind? &#160;The bright fire in Exodus proves it's possible, and
I think the stories of Jesus and Moses indicate it's happening to you.</div><div><br></div><div>&#160;I think it's either keeping you from believing these things are possible, despite&#160;a plethora of scientific evidence through neuroscience that it's not only possible... but we'e been trying to figure out how it's done since at least World War II...</div><div><br></div><div>The things I am presenting to you are&#160;<em>damning evidence</em>, at the precipice we will see that they are nothing
short of ultimate proof--and yet I too see how they might be viewed without scientific statistical analysis as ... <a data-cke-saved-href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm" href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm" class="validating" rel="nofollow">chance</a>,&#160;or coincidence. &#160;There is no doubt in my mind that they are nothing of the sort, and further no doubt that &#160;what appears to be a widespread inability to recognize or investigate this is.... well, it's <em>the
darkness.</em></div></div></div></div><div class="definition-parent"><div class="paragraph" style="font-size: 12px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 5px 0px;"><div aw-variable="value"><div><strong><span style="font-size:15px;">I'm fairly certain that the widespread distribution of this information is not only the&#160;<em>right thing to do</em>, but that it's a clear technical&#160;path to having our heads cleared, in being set free. &#160; It's probably a designed
mechanism to ensure that we remain so, if you understand it was written about 6,000 years ago.</span></strong></div></div></div></div><div class="definition-parent"><div class="paragraph" style="font-size: 12px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 5px 0px;"><div aw-variable="value"><div><span style="font-size:13px;">&#160;This stuff about subconscious voting might seem like the stuff of&#160;<em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&#160;</em>to you today, it might look

purpose of the Apocalypse, and ultimately it's the purpose of civilization: </i><strong>to overcome.</strong></span><br></div><div><span style="font-size:13px;"><strong></strong></span><br></div><div><em><strong>Here</strong>, we can see the darkness manifest itself in our society... we can see SPAM laws and conventions that not only completely violate our First Amendment rights to Free Speech, but also in a system that allows only a small percentage of recipients to stop the entire world from
receiving a message that .... well, it might just be the thing that saves the world. &#160;<strong>Free communication is the "stuff" of democracy, and ultimately of civilization.</strong>&#160;</em>These things are <b>darkness<em>,&#160;</em></b><em></em>whether or not you want to hear from me. &#160;By the way all you have to do is unsubscribe if you don't, clicking that little button that says "it's spam!! it hurts my eyes!!" is stopping your children from being able to be free. &#160;Wake the

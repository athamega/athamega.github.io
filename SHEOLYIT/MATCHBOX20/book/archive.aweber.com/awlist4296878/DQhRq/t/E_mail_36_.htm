    <pre>If you missed some of them, there&#39;s an archive here. [ <a href="http://bit.ly/1U8sW7Y">http://bit.ly/1U8sW7Y</a> ]

Under LockE and KeyNES [ <a href="http://bit.ly/28RQvfL">http://bit.ly/28RQvfL</a> ]

I see patterns within religion that flow into our world, from our history to modern music and movies.  Within this Matrix of Light, exists a prophesy... one that predicts a great Exodus from darkness.   There are five E&#39;s that connect throughout the Bible to Earth.., and together they paint a picture of Creation itself, of a civilization forged in fire.  Between the messianic Den filled with the Family of Christ... and the land of Edom--which I see as clearly being a kingdom with a hidden king, we are at a time where it&#39;s taken an act of God to deliver true freedom to the world.  Religion is the proof of this act, and the story of Exodus--brings us from the land of Earth-gypped and the Ewok to a place where we can clearly see that the slavery of the Jews in Egypt was a metaphor... for simply not knowing that it&#39;s our freedom that is being fought for.   Here in this place, the Darkness is not being created by Moses... but rather made
very clear--it&#39;s about censorship, about hiding the Light of the Son.

I see this light all around us, and because of that it&#39;s clear it&#39;s from the Creator himself.  In everything I do, I am attempting to show you how to find it... so you can verify that for yourselves.  It&#39;s hidden in plain sight, in the names of philosophers and video game systems... in the characters and actors in our movies .. what I call modern myth.  It&#39;s clear evidence, once you take a step back and try to understand the presentation of the message.

The entire world should be seeing this, it&#39;s an inevitability, at the link just below you can see the coverage across the globe that these messages are making.  End the dark night, this light is more than bright... it&#39;s right.

For instance, yesterday I sent a message [ <a href="http://matchbox20.bitbucket.org/archive.aweber.com/awlist4296878/7.AUq/h/This_is_our_You_and_I_verse_.htm">http://matchbox20.bitbucket.org/archive.aweber.com/awlist4296878/7.AUq/h/This_is_our_You_and_I_verse_.htm</a> ] describing how the verses of Ecclesiastes 9:11 relate to a message from the future about universal electronic voting, and use the company Die Bold as an example of who should not be winning the race (election).  In my mind it&#39;s important to realize that not only is the company name related, but the entire situation relating to electronic voting appears to be &#34;Heavenly Theater,&#34; a created story to highlight what might have been a decades (or worse) long delay in the evolution of democracy that the internet and instantaneous communication should be beginning... you know, a few years ago at least.  This message comes highlighted with prescient reference to modern font face and style (courier, and bold) in an ancient Old Testament verse... this alone is brilliant light, and should be cause for pause, and reflection on what it means for these modern computing concepts to be
alluded to thousands of years ago.

There are a huge number of references to modern computing tied directly into religion, from the &#34;root of David,&#34; which I am suggesting is an allusion to the &#34;God account&#34; of Unix systems... something that is made very bright by the name of the book Exodus--read in reverse--which combines the commands &#34;sudo&#34; and &#34;xe.&#34;  sudo escalates to this account, it&#39;s the logical equivalent of &#34;God... do:&#34; and Xe happens to be the name of an Oracle Database... and also the element associate with the flash of a camera.  Together, I read &#34;let there be light&#34; which is the most iconic phrase ever spoken by God.

The names Christ and Eucharist appear to include computer functions, Chr() and Char() pointing out the &#34;t&#34; that is shorthand for Christ in this hidden cipher which is the key to seeing the Matrix linking together historical events and modern art through names and the meaning behind the messages.  In this case, the &#34;t&#34; higlights my birth-sign, The Sign of Sagittarius, which is the sign of anyone born on the day of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception... December 8th.

I see a joke.. in the word &#34;Messiah&#34; relating to this feast... and to the Thunder of Thor--the sound of Joan Osbourne singing about God being a &#34;slob&#34; like of one us... Without my birthday it&#39;s still a cute reference to the word &#34;mess,&#34; but with it... well, I think it shows a clear hidden influence in her lyrics... about knowing my name...  which happens to be DOB-rin, Date of Birth, our in... highlighting again the use of names to tell a hidden story.  The Book of Exodus, which this entire Revelation revolves around happens to be called &#34;Names&#34; in Hebrew.

It&#39;s about seeing proof... and that&#39;s what this is.  What you could dismiss as a serious of coincidences eventually becomes statistical proof that there is in fact a message from the beyond, everywhere around you.

While it may or may not be clear that I am not God, this is the story that he has written for us.  I am a new person, living in his body... the body of our deliverer from slavery.  Through the story of my life, and struggle against the cross--which is clearly represented by the faults in our justice system... he is waging a war against a destruction of the freedom that I&#39;ve shed my grace to defend [ <a href="http://bit.ly/1Xweozj">http://bit.ly/1Xweozj</a> ].  Take heed, this story centers around clear violations of the Constitution of the United States of America by high courts, the Supreme Court of the United States and of Florida... in a number of situations.  At stake are your rights to free speech, to privacy, and to a fair trial--things that he and I are screaming at you to ensure you do not allow to slip through your fingers.

Perhaps more importantly, what hangs in the balance is the truth... about the nature of reality and our hidden history.  Nearly within our reach are technologies which could deliver the place we think of as Heaven... or Utopia right here at home; pre-crime, and the ability to heal the sick and end world hunger.  Understand that through me, you are being given proof that these technologies have been in active use throughout our entire history, without our knowledge.   A huge part of this message revolves around clearly disclosing the existence of these advanced technologies, and wisdom related to how they might be best used in order to help us moving ever so much closer to Heaven.  Believe it or not... it&#39;s in Minority Report, in Total Recall, and in A Scanner Darkly... and in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep--decidedly we do not.  Good morning.

Hand in hand with these technologies comes a message about knowledge, and about Universal Voting, and the day quickly approaches when we will have the ability to use them.  Please ensure that we do much better than nothing. [ <a href="http://bit.ly/28RQvfL">http://bit.ly/28RQvfL</a> ]

I could tell you it&#39;s as simple as looking at wave-function collapse, and seeing that it&#39;s much more easily explained by &#34;virtual reality&#34; than some natural phenomenon... or point out the light, the purpose of religion, hinging around this disclosure that we are much closer to Heaven than we had thought.  I could point out the words of the Lord&#39;s Prayer, that the Earth is in Heaven, or the numerous recent scientific reports suggesting the same.  This is all for a reason, and that reason... is building Heaven.  That start&#39;s here and now. #letfreedomring

It&#39;s not a test, it&#39;s the...

What if God had a name?  Start believing. [<a href="http://bit.ly/1YswLEy">http://bit.ly/1YswLEy</a>]

The Plague of Darkness
21 Then the Lord said to Moses, ???Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt???darkness that can be felt.??? 22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days. 23


To Shamayim.


I&#39;m usually not one for superstition, but for this number I have to pause.  In Judaism this is Double-Chai, it&#39;s the luckiest number in existence... it&#39;s about life, and today I am celebrating.  In our myths, all the way back to ancient Egypt and throughout American history we have stories about what is happening right now, about this Holy Fire.  Yankee Doodle&#39;s riding to town, and this horse is not pale... there reference to a feather is about Shu, son of Osiris&#39; crown, and with little bit of research you will see that the feather is this light--it&#39;s here [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_(Egyptian_god">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_(Egyptian_god</a>) ], if you care to check.

Shamayim is the Hebrew word for Heaven, and from Egyptian myth to Judeo-Christianity there&#39;s a clear message about Heaven being created through water [ <a href="http://bit.ly/2922FV6">http://bit.ly/2922FV6</a> ] and fire... references to Us--the people of the Earth, and the truth.  This is the path... the way we all get there.  ??????????????????????????????????????????

The roots of the word shamayim are ???? (esh, fire) and ?????? (mim, water) The beginning letter ?? (aleph) is a silent stand-in for a beginning consonant, nothing more. Dropping it does not change the meaning of the two-letter word. So the Hebrew ???????? literally means fire in water.
Rabbi Shlomo bar Yitzhak [ <a href="http://www.ijs.org.au/Rabbi-Solomon-Isaac/default.aspx">http://www.ijs.org.au/Rabbi-Solomon-Isaac/default.aspx</a> ] (1040-1105), or Rashi for short, was the greatest of the Jewish commentators on the Old Testament during the Middle Ages. Concerning Genesis 1:8, he says [ <a href="http://www.tachash.org/metsudah/b01r.html">http://www.tachash.org/metsudah/b01r.html</a> ] this:
The word shamayim is a contraction of [a word for] carrying of water, also [a word meaning] there is water, also esh and mim, [meaning] fire and water. He blended them with one another and made the heavens from them.

Holy Water is People, and this is the Sang Rael. [ <a href="http://bit.ly/2922FV6">http://bit.ly/2922FV6</a> ]

It&#39;s probably pertinent to mention that Joshua is the son of Nun [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_(mythology">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_(mythology</a>) ]--what is (to me) a clear Egyptian reference to the prime-ordeal waters--that&#39;s Us.. it&#39;s Humanity.  Seeing the link between these ancient myths and today is part of the shift in understanding just how important this time is to the future.. this transition is literally the focus of all religion... our history, and my being.


The proof is in every one of idioms... from ready or not, here I come to blood is thicker than water.  The Holy Grail comes from seeing this message woven from Genesis to Revelation... expanding the family of Eden... a sea of first initials to the multitude of Revelation... and through seeing the blessing in disguise that is the First Plague... turning water to blood.  This is the &#34;magic&#34; that Exodus describes, perhaps less visual and yet supremely more important.  It&#39;s about the Blood of Christ, in the chalice that we see as Earth--just a jump in time and one letter away from the Heart of Heaven.

See what it means that these idioms fit so perfectly, this is about disclosure... it&#39;s what makes true family.

This is the light of His SOL, it comes from the glowing Sun above... and from the Sons of Liberty, the Statue of Liberty... and seeing this message woven throughout history.  It&#39;s in language, and religion, and standing on the lamp of Judah Maccabee (that&#39;s the Tribe of Revelation 5:5, linking the Hammer of Thor)  ... a derivation of &#34;AH&#34; from the word for the Spirit of God ... Shekinah, to the names of the wives of every Patriarch of Judaism... Sarah, Leah, Rebekkah... to Mary.. that &#34;sea&#34; and this is &#34;why.&#34;  From the name of that lamp, Men or AH? (a question I see posed to the Sons of Liberty... see our light!) it&#39;s clearly all humanity... this Bride of Revelation.

See our Light... it&#39;s about names, time, acronyms... the Sons of Liberty ..and movies. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lMOL7GaPWI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lMOL7GaPWI</a>]

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness
was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God       SHE KIN AH
moved upon the face of the waters.                         ----------
                                                           EVE RY ONE
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

Genesis 1:1-3

Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.


Revelation 10:5


And he shall pitch his palatial tents between the sea and the glorious holy mountain.  (Take 2)  Yet he shall come to his end, with none to help him.?????????????????????

<div style="text-align: justify;">I was just walking down the street pondering the date, on Corbin Ave... and trying to project something useful to the world around me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Artificially smiling and connecting &quot;<a href="/NITY.html">Corbin Dall</a>ass&quot; to t<a href="/CURSOR.html">he 14th Element</a>... and thinking a little bit about what I&#39;m planning on doing instead of e-mailing you five times a day until you call a reporter.<br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">I could write a book about &quot;what I think Heaven is&quot; something that I would prefer not to give away for free--and without any assistance.&nbsp; This&nbsp;<em>throbbing mass of silence</em>&nbsp;should obviously be showing you that the &quot;Valley of the Shadow of Osiris&quot; isn&#39;t really a &quot;victory of all&quot; if you are completely unable to move forward, to put one foot in front of another... to utter a single word about this message.&nbsp; That is the temporary conclusion that I&#39;ve drawn--that &quot;He&quot; has built this thing that I see as organized opposition to me--only because it&#39;s very obviously (and should be to all of you) organized opposition to free thought and free thinking and free speech--I think that&#39;s what I see... he appears to have convinced you all that doing nothing will somehow &quot;gain ground&quot; in your war on Adam.&nbsp; It might, it seems you&#39;ve overcome me--I&#39;m giving up--I flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Now what?</em></div>

<div>Anyway the point of this is to ask you if you see any more, any more of these kinds of polarized &quot;rubber tire bumpers&quot; on our go-kart track--I haven&#39;t thought much about but I do imagine that there are quite a few more... maybe even just in this one specific place.&nbsp; You probably don&#39;t dislike the idea of a &quot;religion&quot; or using that word as much as I do--or maybe you do by now--but this is the foundation of the thing that I was going to call a &quot;religion of the stars&quot; until I re-read that Nostrisadamus quattraine about the &quot;religion of the sea&quot; prevailing over the that of the Son of Adaluncatif.&nbsp; I used to think it was &quot;Adam&quot; misspelled, <span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">I C AL</span> now.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>Rad</b></span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>As <i><span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">sea parting words</span></i>, it does appear that the idea of a &quot;Stargate&quot; itself is one of the bumpers, but I see it as a &quot;too little magic&quot; or a &quot;too much secrecy&quot; bumper--as opposed to having transporters on every Starship they&#39;re only buried in Cheyenne Mountain and Ant ark-C-TI ?&nbsp; My solution, you know--following my pattern and faux circumstances of only <a href="http://its%20you%2C%20blow%20me/">having one chance and having to do it overnight</a>... would be to stick a gate in every bus station--or something like that.&nbsp; You have to think, eventually we will have Hyperloops to Mars, right?&nbsp; Think about it as just getting us there while you are alive instead of three generations later; same thing with my rod.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2mxKCw1" target="_blank">I said Doors.</a></div>

<div>The way out is clear, you appear to have jack shit right now, as in &quot;jacked into my head&quot; as you walk around Hell with a feeling of &quot;complacency&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s good enough&quot; or &quot;gee those sunrises are pretty&quot; that&#39;s just about as artificial as my smiles.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think any of you <a href="http://key.s.lamc.la/">realize how strong this technology is</a>--how much <i><a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/SPEECH.html">it influences how you feel and what you think</a></i>--how much it is keeping you today from seeing the impact of the moral imperative to &quot;stop pain&quot;--just for instance.&nbsp; It&#39;s partially because of his selfish need to &quot;show you&quot; how he could have simulated all of our history--thousands of years, knowing this message was here and knowing this was really the point of it all... the whole time.&nbsp; Part of it probably comes from something I&#39;ve kept as a kind of hidden salve--the idea that these short lives that begin everything for us--the seat of our souls, the time spent here is minuscule compared to what is to come... I still imagine that&#39;s guaranteed.&nbsp; Still these are &quot;formative years&quot; as we see clearly in our children growing up, and I feel like we&#39;ve been beaten with more than a ruler in parochial school, I am scared that what his crucible of &quot;needed change&quot; and &quot;absolute stagnation&quot; is creating in us is something that the bright outlook of thousands of years of thriving can&#39;t--and shouldn&#39;t have to &quot;make all better.&quot;&nbsp;</div>

<div>For some time, I imagine we will look back on these few years of radical hidden change and totally hidden lack of freedom with disdain and disgust, a sort of contempt that really is hard to fathom--how could we have done nothing for so long--how could anyone or anything have created a situation like this intentionally--how are we still stuck at &quot;<b><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">hel</span><span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;"> lo&nbsp;</span></b>?&quot;</div>

<p>If I were someone else, or if this was another life it would probably be a little presumptuous of me to assume, and now to be very sure that the mark of &quot;DAY&quot; here is defined as &quot;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">my why</span>;&quot; my ultimate goal.&nbsp; It&#39;s the meaning of those two letters, the &quot;dark to Adam&quot; <i><b>the</b>&nbsp;</i>that is one in a series I&#39;ve talked about a few times--<a href="http://thor.lamc.la/" target="_blank">&quot;le&quot; in Jerusalem</a> and &quot;El&quot; in Elm Street; <a href="http://math.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">Ha in Hebrew</a>&nbsp;... all of those revolving around the &quot;m&quot; that keys to &quot;Amsterdam&quot; <i>and Ham</i> and and I&#39;d probably call understanding that &quot;his why&#39; understanding that it&#39;s &quot;<i>the Holy message</i>&quot; and that it&#39;s you--written by you, with you, and through you--it&#39;s the whole world around us, that&#39;s the message.&nbsp; Avoiding <i><a href="http://blow%20me/">disasters</a></i> and <i><a href="http://gate.s.lamc.la/">masters</a></i> is a simple feat--it&#39;s seeing that you probably really do agree with quite a bit of what the message says--and in my eyes it&#39;s really caring, really working to make it a reality.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s obvious, I think I shouldn&#39;t have to tell you that you need to participate in self government to avoid masters.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify; width: 500px;">
<div>If it wasn&#39;t for the serendipitous synchronistic connection in this moment between &quot;da y&quot; and &quot;ma y&quot;--another in a series of linguistic keys to &quot;alphabet soup spirits&quot; and the word &quot;my&quot; (see mire and mare) ... I wouldn&#39;t be so very sure that these &quot;why&#39;s&quot; are without doubt mine.&nbsp; I see pretty clearly that breaking down the barrier of simulated reality ... public discussion of it&#39;s repercussions and the possibilities opened--especially after seeing the words that I&#39;ve written,&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">if not signed by me</span>&nbsp;then at least signed by God&#39;s hand... that we will see a quick cascade and a fairly swift change in popular opinion about just how much of our world needs to be changed.&nbsp; While it&#39;s clear that optometrists and police will probably have significantly less work to do--not recognizing the moral need to end blindness and murder at the system level ... when that possibility is available is the difference between playing a game and &quot;actual society.&quot;<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Along those lines, it is my ultimate goal for this place to get to the point where we have &quot;Doors to Heaven&quot; ... something I&#39;ve written about being encoded in my family history for generations and we can see hear it in Jim Morrison&#39;s music and ... and it really is the difference between living in Westworld either voluntarily or involuntarily and being in a place that physically can continue to exist and participating in a civilization that deserves to.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no way to reality from this shit hole, I promise you that--there never was, this place is clearly designed from Gates to Seagate for you to see that we are being given the tools of understanding computers-so we can understand where we are, and what the differences between reality and Earth are.&nbsp; You can see it as a test, or you can see it as the blunt truth; if you don&#39;t think the blind need to be made to see, I don&#39;t want you.&nbsp; Least of all would I want something like that in the Holiest place of all, in reality--where that disgusting lack of regard for humanity would have any ability to alter, influence, or control what&#39;s &quot;inside Heaven.&quot;<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>If yo<a href="http://alf.s.lamc.la">u &quot;get</a></em> <a href="http://dessert.s.lamc.la">what I&#39;m writing about</a>&quot; in the beginning of this message, there are plenty of things that I wouldn&#39;t do here--there&#39;s plenty of &quot;magic&quot; that might be fun in a game, in a small room in Heaven... that has no place in a &quot;room&quot; shared by billions--and maybe if you start thinking and talking, I&#39;ll have more of a desire to write about those things, instead of telling you I see light in &quot;<strong>puke</strong>&quot; (which means, &quot;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">p: you know everything</span>&quot;) and &quot;<strong>yuck</strong>&quot; until you think C.K. means hidden--I&#39;m really not hidden at all, am I?</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:10px;">Since Bianca&#39;s is closely tied, I&#39;m going to comment on &quot;<strong>ILE</strong>&quot; (and add it to the list of what appears to be Trinitish personality keys.. see <a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/YAT.html">&quot;EAR&quot; and &quot;OLE&quot;</a>&nbsp;... &quot;<a href="http://FUCK.s.lamc.la">UCK</a>&quot; seems to work too)&nbsp;and the related aspects of <a href="http://b.s.lamc.la">B</a>, <a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/PULL.html">P</a>, <a href="http://thor.lamc.la">F</a>, <a href="http://bush.reallyhim.com">N</a>, <a href="http://ole.s.lamc.la"><strong>V</strong></a>, <a href="http://homile.reallyhim.com">M</a>, <a href="http://dick.s.lamc.la">L</a>, and <a href="http://alf.s.lamc.la">R</a>... and remind you it means &quot;<em>I&#39;m weak (and <strong>al</strong>most <strong>ass</strong>uredly <strong>ri</strong>ght).</em>&quot;&nbsp; I don&#39;t get Taylor&#39;s, <em>do you?&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, rug, <a href="http://car.s.lamc.la">car</a>pet, flo<strong>or</strong> ... are you g?&nbsp; </em></span><span style="font-size:10px;"><em><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/holy_water,_sang_rael.html">Walk on any<span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">one el</span>se lately</a>?</em></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I think it&#39;s clear--but you are still silent--that a rational open discussion about the truth will lead us to something that we want, rather than living a lie for what amounts to no reason.&nbsp; I believe the thing &quot;we want&quot; will change with time, but frankly that &quot;popular opinion&quot; will very quickly move against &quot;doing nothing&quot; and we might start to see how we could be better organized in the light of &quot;<b>da y</b>&quot; to ask more useful questions of ourselves, and set more reasonable goals--for instance &quot;we will not force other people and ourselves to be silent&quot; as a starting point, and then perhaps &quot;we will not allow other people and ourselves to be tortured&quot; as a good first step in the process of what is nothing less than ending Hell and eradicating things like &quot;unnecessary pain&quot; with the light of <span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><i>the rockets red glare </i>and </span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">you</span><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">.</span>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Above you can see my new rendition of &quot;<strong><span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">don&#39;t be the lake</span></strong>&quot; it was my hope and my dream that this place would be <i>an <span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">angel</span> creator</i>, and that of our family we would be able to deliver peace and protection to the whole of Creation, and the future--that we would be responsible not only for showing them what &quot;morality&quot; really means, but how much our goodness helps a society thrive and adapt to change--one that in this place, in this case, should be nearly universally&nbsp;<strong>awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>The path is clear, imagine you&#39;ve been lead around a mountain, on a beaten but sparse trail--following me because that&#39;s where the trail went... and we&#39;ve just come to a clearing, and there&#39;s no more trail.&nbsp; I&#39;m sticking a sign in the ground here that says &quot;<strong>try&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">speaking</span>: I have a better idea.</strong>&quot;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">So &quot;<span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;"><b>AKE</b></span>&quot; appears to be a sort of linguistic key similar to&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CINOIZE.html">CINOIZE</a>,&nbsp;</strong>which is code for &quot;get the fuck out of my head.&quot;&nbsp; <a href="http://gate.s.lamc.la">L and</a> <a href="http://math.s.lamc.la">M app</a>ear to have useful commentary on why there might be a sea of people&nbsp;<em>still stuck apparently at&nbsp;</em>&quot;<u><strong>da&nbsp;</strong></u><em><strong><u>let</u> me come</strong>&quot; and&nbsp;</em>you&#39;re frozen in a state of useless Fringe amber; which appears to be somehow keeping you from having any kind of useful public conversation about &quot;the secrets of the Universe&quot; and the very obvious message from God in every single word pointing you to me, so that I can tell you&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-family: comic sans ms, sans-serif;">don&#39;t be <em>the lake</em></span></strong>--the thing that swallows up <a href="http://gate.s.lamc.la">Arthur&#39;s sword</a> an the power to change the world using &quot;magick.&quot;&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">The implication is that perhaps th<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/MEDICINE.html">is &quot;e</a>&quot;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://eve.s.lamc.la/">thing</a>&nbsp;</strong>that annoys me ever so much by singing songs about me and then refusing to acknowledge they have anything at all to do with &quot;the Second Coming,&quot; the implication is that per<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/MEDICINE.html">haps this &quot;e&quot;</a> thing already has&nbsp;<a href="http://gate.s.lamc.la/">the functionality required</a>&nbsp;to make the kinds of changes that this message very clearly indicates we should all be thinking and talking about making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Of course it certainly doesn&#39;t seem to have what I&nbsp;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/SPEECH.html">think would be required, voting and freedom from the hidden</a>&nbsp;tech<a href="http://key.s.lamc.la/">nological manipulat</a>ion that this message focuses on--so perhaps rather than thinking or &quot;pretending to vote&quot; about me, why don&#39;t you decide to be able to&nbsp;<em>speak freely</em>&nbsp;about the message.&nbsp; A simple way to do that would be to join&nbsp;<a href="http://slack.reallyhim.com/">this slack channel</a>&nbsp;which is a chat room just for talking about nothing but&nbsp;<em><a href="http://art.s.lamc.la/">this</a>&nbsp;message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It&#39;s long been pretty obvious to me that the secret communication that I definitely see going on might have some future use related to voting--though not having a transparent record of communication and not being able to see any discussion about it sort of precludes the possibility that it&#39;s in any way free.&nbsp; I&#39;ve even pondered the idea of subconscious universal voting--including your opinions in the outcome of a vote even if you didn&#39;t think the idea or matter important enough to do something like go to a website and click a little button (say, on whether or not you should be able to talk) and through this entire ordeal I&#39;ve been very sure that the concept of our &quot;<em>Social Security Number</em>&quot; here in this place is a metaphorical map to a verification table that would allow you to see if that subconscious vote was accurate, if your vote was accurately recorded--and would basically allow for pseudo-privacy and ensure that no elections were ever rigged.&nbsp; Of course, I&#39;ve mentioned it a few times but you probably don&#39;t remember, or didn&#39;t read that far into my futuristic musings on a system that probably already exists in some way of &quot;<a href="http://sois.s.lamc.la/">looking at time</a>.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; The point is that whatever I am looking at has no written record or really any way at all to see &quot;what&#39;s going on&quot; and that this is obviously a tool designed to <a href="http://art.s.lamc.la">perpetuate a series of conflicting lies</a>.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">It does look very obviously, that something invisible and not here is trying to use you to &quot;weild the power of Thor&quot; to do something that is ... clearly not what you are talking about doing--and more importantly probably not what you would want to do if you were having a clear coherent conversation about this message telling us to start with &quot;<em>ending world hunger</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>healing the sick.</em>&quot;&nbsp; Literally, nobody is visibly talking about the most important, pivotal, and clearly unavoidable disclosure in all of history--even though we seem to all be thinking about it.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">In short it&#39;s very clear that something here has placated nearly everyone into believing that they still have a &quot;say&quot; or an idea about what&#39;s going on--even though there&#39;s no surface response in the media or in social media that I can see at all--indicating very much that everyone has been &quot;duped&quot; into not realizing that the Washington Post is very much correct when the inform you that &quot;<strong>democracy dies in darkness</strong>&quot; and it should be a fairly obvious indication that you are sitting right smack at what might be the very darkest point of the eponymous Plague of Exodus--something I remind myself is always the time period right before dawn.&nbsp; Whatever it is, the point is that not allowing a public response to something that is very much everyone&#39;s business and really very obviously everywhere is probably not really something&nbsp;<a href="http://gate.s.lamc.la/">you or I</a>&nbsp;are deciding.&nbsp; Still, very few people have&nbsp;<em><a href="http://slack.reallyhim.com/">joined the Slack channel</a></em>&nbsp;to talk about it; and I imagine even less have called a reporter.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Feel bad for me, because if you don&#39;t see what I see every day this probably sounds like I lept off the deep end--except the world I see is falling, falling, falling as far from &quot;civilization&quot; as you can imagine, and I don&#39;t know how to tell you that the global lack of response to this information is basically the same thing--even if everything else appears normal.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know how to reconcile the two worlds that must be involved in completely ignoring something of this import, and yet <em><a href="http://rix.s.lamc.la/">the virtual sphere</a> still <b><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;">turns</span></b>...</em></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><em>Enough people have joined that Slack to show me that you are capable, I really have no way to personally reconcile the visible interest I see in email statistics with the fact that&nbsp;<strong>not a single reporter has asked me a question</strong></em>&nbsp;and you could say that the questions I do see are significantly less frequent than I expected--there is clearly something very, very wrong here--and frankly &quot;seeing everything I see&quot; as is implied by the <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/MEDICINE.html">concept of &quot;e&quot;</a> is not enough for nobody to be interested in more.&nbsp;</div>
